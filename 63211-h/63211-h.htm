<p class="caption3">THE LURE OF THE OUTFITTER</p>


<p>When the brig <i>Alexander</i> sailed out of
San Francisco on a whaling voyage a
few years ago, I was a member of her
forecastle crew. Once outside the Golden Gate,
I felt the swing of blue water under me for the
first time in my life. I was not shanghaied.
Let's have that settled at the start. I had
shipped as a green hand before the mast for the
adventure of the thing, because I wanted to go,
for the glamor of the sea was upon me.</p>

<p>I was taking breakfast in a San Francisco
restaurant when, in glancing over the morning
paper, I chanced across this advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Wanted</span>&mdash;Men for a whaling voyage; able seamen, ordinary
seamen, and green hands. No experience necessary. Big money for a
lucky voyage. Apply at Levy's, No. 12 Washington Street.</p></div>

<p>Until that moment I had never dreamed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12 ]</a></span>
going to sea, but that small "ad." laid its spell
upon my imagination. It was big with the lure
of strange lands and climes, romance and fresh
experiences. What did it matter that I had
passed all my humdrum days on dry land? "No
experience necessary!" There were the magic
words staring me in the face. I gulped down
my eggs and coffee and was off for the street
called Washington.</p>

<p>Levy's was a ship's outfitting store. A "runner"
for the house&mdash;a hulking man with crafty
eyes and a face almost as red as his hair and
mustache&mdash;met me as I stepped in the door. He
looked me over critically. His visual inventory
must have been satisfactory. I was young.</p>

<p>"Ever been a sailor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Makes no difference. Can you pull an
oar?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You'll do. Hang around the store to-day
and I'll see what vessels are shipping crews."</p>

<p>That was all. I was a potential whaler from
that minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[ 13 ]</a></span></p>

<p>A young working man in overalls and flannel
shirt came in later in the day and applied to go
on the voyage. He qualified as a green hand.
But no spirit of adventure had brought him to
Levy's. A whaling voyage appealed to his
canny mind as a business proposition.</p>

<p>"What can we make?" he asked the runner.</p>

<p>"If your ship is lucky," replied the runner,
"you ought to clean up a pile of money. You'll
ship on the 190th lay. Know what a lay is? It's
your per cent. of the profits of the voyage. Say
your ship catches four whales. She ought to
catch a dozen if she has good luck. But say she
catches four. Her cargo in oil and bone will be
worth about $50,000. Your share will amount
to something like $200, and you'll get it in a
lump sum when you get back."</p>

<p>This was "bunk talk"&mdash;a "springe to catch
woodcock"&mdash;but we did not know it. That
fluent and plausible man took pencil and paper
and showed us just how it would all work out.
It was reserved for us poor greenhorns to learn
later on that sailors of whaling ships usually are
paid off at the end of a voyage with "one big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14 ]</a></span>
iron dollar." This fact being discreetly withheld
from us, our illusions were not disturbed.</p>

<p>The fact is the "lay" means nothing to sailors
on a whaler. It is merely a lure for the unsophisticated.
It might as well be the 1000th
lay as the 190th, for all the poor devil of a sailor
gets. The explanation is simple. The men
start the voyage with an insufficient supply of
clothing. By the time the vessel strikes cold
weather their clothes are worn out and it is a
case of buy clothes from the ship's slop-chest at
the captain's own prices or freeze. As a consequence,
the men come back to port with expense
accounts standing against them which wipe out
all possible profits. This has become so definitely
a part of whaling custom that no sailor
ever thinks of fighting against it, and it probably
would do him no good if he did. As a forecastle
hand's pay the "big iron dollar" is a
whaling tradition and as fixed and inevitable as
fate.</p>

<p>The outfitter who owned the store did not
conduct a sailor's boarding house, so we were put
up at a cheap hotel on Pacific street. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15 ]</a></span>
supper, my new friend took me for a visit to
the home of his uncle in the Tar Flats region.
A rough, kindly old laboring man was this uncle
who sat in his snug parlor in his shirt sleeves
during our stay, sent one of the children to the
corner for a growler of beer, and told us bluntly
we were idiots to think of shipping on a whaling
voyage. We laughed at his warning&mdash;we were
going and that's all there was to it. The old
fellow's pretty daughters played the piano and
sang for us, and my last evening on shore passed
pleasantly enough. When it came time to say
good-bye, the uncle prevailed on my friend to
stay all night on the plea that he had some urgent
matters to talk over, and I went back alone
to my dingy hotel on the Barbary Coast.</p>

<p>I was awakened suddenly out of a sound
sleep in the middle of the night. My friend
stood beside my bed with a lighted candle in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Get up and come with me," he said. "Don't
go whaling. My uncle has told me all about it.
He knows. You'll be treated like a dog aboard,
fed on rotten grub, and if you don't die under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16 ]</a></span>
the hard knocks or freeze to death in the Arctic
Ocean, you won't get a penny when you get
back. Don't be a fool. Take my advice and
give that runner the slip. If you go, you'll regret
it to the last day of your life."</p>

<p>In the yellow glare of the candle, the young
man seemed not unlike an apparition and he delivered
his message of warning with prophetic solemnity
and impressiveness. But my mind was
made up.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go," I said.</p>

<p>He argued and pleaded with me, all to no
purpose. He set the candle on the table and
blew it out.</p>

<p>"You won't come?" he said out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You're a fool."</p>

<p>He slammed the door. I never saw him again.
But many a time on the long voyage I recalled
his wise counsel, prompted as it was by pure
friendliness, and wished from my heart I had
taken his advice.</p>

<p>Next day the runner for Levy's tried to ship
me aboard the steam whaler <i>William Lewis</i>.
When we arrived at the shipping office on the
water front, it was crowded with sailors and
rough fellows, many of them half drunk, and all
eager for a chance to land a berth. A bronzed
and bearded man stood beside a desk and surveyed
them. He was the skipper of the steamer.
The men were pushing and elbowing in an effort
to get to the front and catch his eye.</p>

<p>"I've been north before, captain," "I'm an
able seaman, sir," "I know the ropes," "Give
me a chance, captain," "Take me, sir; I'll make
a good hand,"&mdash;so they clamored their virtues
noisily. The captain chose this man and that.
In twenty minutes his crew was signed. It was
not a question of getting enough men; it was a
mere matter of selection. In such a crowd of
sailormen, I stood no show. In looking back on
it all, I wonder how such shipping office scenes
are possible, how men of ordinary intelligence
are herded aboard whale ships like sheep, how
they even fight for a chance to go.</p>

<p>It was just as well I failed to ship aboard the
<i>William Lewis</i>. The vessel went to pieces in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[ 18 ]</a></span>
the ice on the north Alaskan coast the following
spring. Four men lost their lives and only after
a bitter experience as castaways on the floes were
the others rescued.</p>

<p>That afternoon Captain Shorey of the brig
<i>Alexander</i> visited Levy's. I was called to his
attention as a likely young hand and he shipped
me as a member of his crew. I signed articles
for a year's voyage. It was provided that I was
to receive a $50 advance with which to outfit
myself for the voyage; of course, any money left
over after all necessary articles had been purchased
was to be mine&mdash;at least, in my innocence,
I imagined it was.</p>

<p>The brig was lying in the stream off Goat
Island and the runner set about the work of outfitting
me at once. He and I and a clerk went
about the store from shelf to shelf, selecting
articles. The runner carried a pad of paper on
which he marked down the cost. I was given a
sailor's canvas bag, a mattress, a pair of blankets,
woolen trousers, dungaree trousers, a coat,
a pair of brogans, a pair of rubber sea boots, underwear,
socks, two flannel shirts, a cap, a belt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[ 19 ]</a></span>
and sheath knife, a suit of oil-skins and sou'wester,
a tin cup, tin pan, knife, fork and spoon.
That was all. It struck me as a rather slender
equipment for a year's voyage. The runner
footed up the cost.</p>

<p>"Why," he said with an air of great surprise,
"this foots up to $53 and your advance is only
$50."</p>

<p>He added up the column of figures again.
But he had made no mistake. He seemed perplexed.</p>

<p>"I don't see how it is possible to scratch off
anything," he said. "You'll need every one of
these articles."</p>

<p>He puckered his brow, bit the end of his pencil,
and studied the figures. It was evidently a
puzzling problem.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "I'll tell you what
I'll do. Bring me down a few curios from the
Arctic and I'll call it square."</p>

<p>I suppose my outfit was really worth about
$6&mdash;not over $10. As soon as my bag had been
packed, I was escorted to the wharf by the runner
and rowed out to the brig. As I prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20 ]</a></span>
to climb over the ship's rail, the runner shook
me by the hand and clapped me on the back with
a great show of cordial goodfellowship.</p>

<p>"Don't forget my curios," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THE MEN OF THE "ALEXANDER"</p>


<p>The brig <i>Alexander</i> was a staunch, sea-worthy
little vessel. She had no fine lines;
there was nothing about her to please a
yachtsman's eye; but she was far from being a
tub as whaling ships are often pictured. She
was built at New Bedford especially for Arctic
whaling. Her hull was of sturdy oak, reinforced
at the bows to enable her to buck her way
through ice.</p>

<p>Though she was called a brig, she was really
a brigantine, rigged with square sails on her
fore-mast and with fore-and-aft sails on her
main. She was of only 128 tons but quite lofty,
her royal yard being eighty feet above the deck.
On her fore-mast she carried a fore-sail, a single
topsail, a fore-top-gallant sail, and a royal; on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[ 22 ]</a></span>
her main-mast, a big mainsail with a gaff-topsail
above it. Three whale boats&mdash;starboard, larboard,
and waist boats&mdash;hung at her davits.
Amidships stood the brick try-works equipped
with furnaces and cauldrons for rendering blubber
into oil.</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived on board I was taken in
charge by the ship keeper and conducted to the
forecastle. It was a dark, malodorous, triangular
hole below the deck in the bows. At the
foot of the ladder-like stairs, leading down
through the scuttle, I stepped on something soft
and yielding. Was it possible, I wondered in
an instant's flash of surprise, that the forecastle
was laid with a velvet carpet? No, it was not.
It was only a Kanaka sailor lying on the floor
dead drunk. The bunks were ranged round the
walls in a double tier. I selected one for myself,
arranged my mattress and blankets, and
threw my bag inside. I was glad to get back to
fresh air on deck as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Members of the crew kept coming aboard in
charge of runners and boarding bosses. They
were a hard looking lot; several were staggering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[ 23 ]</a></span>
drunk, and most of them were tipsy. All had
bottles and demijohns of whiskey. Everybody
was full of bad liquor and high spirits that first
night on the brig. A company of jolly sea rovers
were we, and we joked and laughed and roared
out songs like so many pirates about to cruise
for treasure galleons on the Spanish Main.
Somehow next morning the rose color had faded
out of the prospect and there were many aching
heads aboard.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day, the officers
came out to the vessel. A tug puffed alongside
and made fast to us with a cable. The anchor
was heaved up and, with the tug towing us, we
headed for the Golden Gate. Outside the harbor
heads, the tug cast loose and put back into
the bay in a cloud of smoke. The brig was left
swinging on the long swells of the Pacific.</p>

<p>The captain stopped pacing up and down the
quarter-deck and said something to the mate.
His words seemed like a match to powder. Immediately
the mate began roaring out orders.
Boat-steerers bounded forward, shouting out the
orders in turn. The old sailors sang them out in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[ 24 ]</a></span>
repetition. Men sprang aloft. Loosened sails
were soon rolling down and fluttering from every
spar. The sailors began pulling on halyards and
yo-hoing on sheets. Throughout the work of
setting sail, the green hands were "at sea" in a
double sense. The bustle and apparent confusion
of the scene seemed to savor of bedlam broke
loose. The orders were Greek to them. They
stood about, bewildered and helpless. Whenever
they tried to help the sailors they invariably
snarled things up and were roundly abused for
their pains. One might fancy they could at least
have helped pull on a rope. They couldn't even
do that. Pulling on a rope, sailor-fashion, is in
itself an art.</p>

<p>Finally all the sails were sheeted home. Ropes
were coiled up and hung neatly on belaying pins.
A fresh breeze set all the snowy canvas drawing
and the brig, all snug and shipshape, went careering
southward.</p>

<p>At the outset of the voyage, the crew consisted
of twenty-four men. Fourteen men were in the
forecastle. The after-crew comprised the captain,
mate, second mate, third mate, two boat-steerers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[ 25 ]</a></span>
steward, cooper, cook, and cabin boy.
Captain Shorey was not aboard. He was to
join the vessel at Honolulu. Mr. Winchester,
the mate, took the brig to the Hawaiian Islands
as captain. This necessitated a graduated rise
in authority all along the line. Mr. Landers,
who had shipped as second mate, became mate;
Gabriel, the regular third mate, became second
mate; and Mendez, a boatsteerer, was advanced
to the position of third mate.</p>

<p>Captain Winchester was a tall, spare, vigorous
man with a nose like Julius Caesar's and a
cavernous bass voice that boomed like a sunset
gun. He was a man of some education, which
is a rarity among officers of whale ships, and was
a typical New England Yankee. He had run
away to sea as a boy and had been engaged in
the whaling trade for twenty years. For thirteen
years, he had been sailing to the Arctic
Ocean as master and mate of vessels, and was
ingrained with the autocratic traditions of the
quarter-deck. Though every inch a sea dog of
the hard, old-fashioned school, he had his kindly
human side, as I learned later. He was by far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[ 26 ]</a></span>
the best whaleman aboard the brig; as skillful
and daring as any that ever laid a boat on a
whale's back; a fine, bold, hardy type of seaman
and an honor to the best traditions of the sea.
He lost his life&mdash;poor fellow&mdash;in a whaling
adventure in the Arctic Ocean on his next
voyage.</p>

<p>Mr. Landers, the mate, was verging on sixty;
his beard was grizzled, but there wasn't a streak
of gray in his coal-black hair. He was stout and
heavy-limbed and must have been remarkably
strong in his youth. He was a Cape Codder and
talked with a quaint, nasal, Yankee drawl. He
had been to sea all his life and was a whaleman
of thirty years' experience. In all these years,
he had been ashore very little&mdash;only a few weeks
between his year-long voyages, during which
time, it was said, he kept up his preference for
liquids, exchanging blue water for red liquor.
He was a picturesque old fellow, and was so accustomed
to the swinging deck of a ship under
him that standing or sitting, in perfectly still
weather or with the vessel lying motionless at
anchor, he swayed his body from side to side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[ 27 ]</a></span>
heavily as if in answer to the rise and fall of
waves. He was a silent, easy-going man, with
a fund of dry humor and hard common sense.
He never did any more work than he had to, and
before the voyage ended, he was suspected by
the officers of being a malingerer. All the sailors
liked him.</p>

<p>Gabriel, the second mate, was a negro from
the Cape Verde islands. His native language
was Portuguese and he talked funny, broken
English. He was about forty-five years old,
and though he was almost as dark-skinned as
any Ethiopian, he had hair and a full beard as
finely spun and free from kinkiness as a Caucasian's.
The sailors used to say that Gabriel
was a white man born black by accident. He was
a kindly, cheerful soul with shrewd native wit.
He was a whaleman of life-long experience.</p>

<p>Mendez, the third mate, and Long John, one
of the boatsteerers, were also Cape Verde islanders.
Long John was a giant, standing six feet,
four inches; an ungainly, powerful fellow, with
a black face as big as a ham and not much more
expressive. He had the reputation of being one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28 ]</a></span>
of the most expert harpooners of the Arctic
Ocean whaling fleet.</p>

<p>Little Johnny, the other boatsteerer, was a
mulatto from the Barbadoes, English islands of
the West Indies. He was a strapping, intelligent
young man, brimming over with vitality
and high spirits and with all a plantation darky's
love of fun. His eyes were bright and his cheeks
ruddy with perfect health; he loved dress and
gay colors and was quite the dandy of the crew.</p>

<p>Five of the men of the forecastle were deep-water
sailors. Of these one was an American,
one a German, one a Norwegian, and two
Swedes. They followed the sea for a living and
had been bunkoed by their boarding bosses into
believing they would make large sums of money
whaling. They had been taken in by a confidence
game as artfully as the man who loses his
money at the immemorial trick of three shells
and a pea. When they learned they would get
only a dollar at the end of the voyage and contemplated
the loss of an entire working year,
they were full of resentment and righteous,
though futile, anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Taylor, the American, became the acknowledged
leader of the forecastle. He quickly established
himself in this position, not only by his
skill and long experience as a seaman, but by
his aggressiveness, his domineering character,
and his physical ability to deal with men and situations.
He was a bold, iron-fisted fellow to
whom the green hands looked for instruction
and advice, whom several secretly feared, and
for whom all had a wholesome respect.</p>

<p>Nels Nelson, a red-haired, red-bearded old
Swede, was the best sailor aboard. He had had
a thousand adventures on all the seas of all the
world. He had been around Cape Horn seven
times&mdash;a sailor is not rated as a really-truly
sailor until he has made a passage around that
stormy promontory&mdash;and he had rounded the
Cape of Good Hope so many times he had lost
the count. He had ridden out a typhoon on the
coast of Japan and had been driven ashore by a
hurricane in the West Indies. He had sailed
on an expedition to Cocos Island, that realm of
mystery and romance, to try to lift pirate treasure
in doubloons, plate, and pieces-of-eight, supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[ 30 ]</a></span>
to have been buried there by "Bugs"
Thompson and Benito Bonito, those one-time
terrors of the Spanish Main. He had been cast
away in the South Seas in an open boat with
three companions, and had eaten the flesh of the
man whose fate had been sealed by the casting
of lots. He was some man, was Nelson. I sometimes
vaguely suspected he was some liar, too,
but I don't know. I think most of his stories
were true.</p>

<p>He could do deftly everything intricate and
subtle in sailorcraft from tying the most wonderful
knots to splicing wire. None of the officers
could teach old Nelson anything about
fancy sailorizing and they knew it. Whenever
they wanted an unusual or particularly difficult
piece of work done they called on him, and he
always did it in the best seamanly fashion.</p>

<p>Richard, the German, was a sturdy, manly
young chap who had served in the German navy.
He was well educated and a smart seaman. Ole
Oleson, the Norwegian, was just out of his teens
but a fine sailor. Peter Swenson, a Swede, was
a chubby, rosy boy of sixteen, an ignorant, reckless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[ 31 ]</a></span>
devil-may-care lad, who was looked upon
as the baby of the forecastle and humored and
spoiled accordingly.</p>

<p>Among the six white green hands, there was
a "mule skinner" from western railway construction
camps; a cowboy who believed himself
fitted for the sea after years of experience on the
"hurricane deck" of a bucking broncho; a country
boy straight from the plow and with
"farmer" stamped all over him in letters of
light; a man suspected of having had trouble
with the police; another who, in lazy night
watches, spun frank yarns of burglaries; and
"Slim," an Irishman who said he had served
with the Royal Life Guards in the English army.
There was one old whaler. He was a shiftless,
loquacious product of city slums. This was his
seventh whaling voyage&mdash;which would seem sufficient
comment on his character.</p>

<p>"It beats hoboing," he said. And as his life's
ambition seemed centered on three meals a day
and a bunk to sleep in, perhaps it did.</p>

<p>Two Kanakas completed the forecastle crew.
These and the cabin boy, who was also a Kanaka,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[ 32 ]</a></span>
talked fair English, but among themselves they
always spoke their native language. I had heard
much of the liquid beauty of the Kanaka tongue.
It was a surprise to find it the most unmusical
and harshly guttural language I ever heard. It
comes from the mouth in a series of explosive
grunts and gibberings. The listener is distinctly
and painfully impressed with the idea that if the
nitroglycerine words were retained in the system,
they would prove dangerous to health and
is fearful lest they choke the spluttering Kanaka
to death before he succeeds in biting them off and
flinging them into the atmosphere.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">WHY WE DON'T DESERT</p>


<p>As soon as we were under sail, the crew was
called aft and the watches selected. Gabriel
was to head the starboard watch and
Mendez the port. The men were ranged in line
and the heads of the watches made their selections,
turn and turn about. The deep-water sailors
were the first to be chosen. The green hands
were picked for their appearance of strength
and activity. I fell into the port watch.</p>

<p>Sea watches were now set&mdash;four hours for
sleep and four for work throughout the twenty-four.
My watch was sent below. No one slept
during this first watch below, but we made up
for lost time during our second turn. Soon we
became accustomed to the routine and found it
as restful as the usual landsman's method of
eight hours' sleep and sixteen of wakefulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[ 34 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult for a landlubber to understand
how sailors on shipboard can be kept constantly
busy. The brig was a veritable hive of industry.
The watch on deck when morning broke pumped
ship and swept and flushed down the decks. During
the day watches, in addition to working the
ship, we were continuously breaking out supplies,
keeping the water barrel on deck filled
from casks in the hold, laboring with the cargo,
scrubbing paint work, polishing brass work,
slushing masts and spars, repairing rigging, and
attending to a hundred and one details that must
be looked after every day. The captain of a
ship is one of the most scrupulous housekeepers
in the world, and only by keeping his crew busy
from morning till night is he able to keep his
ship spick and span and in proper repair. Whale
ships are supposed to be dirty. On the contrary,
they are kept as clean as water and brooms and
hard work can keep them.</p>

<p>The food served aboard the brig was nothing
to brag about. Breakfast consisted of corned-beef
hash, hardtack, and coffee without milk or
sugar. We sweetened our coffee with molasses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[ 35 ]</a></span>
a keg of which was kept in the forecastle. For
dinner, we had soup, corned-beef stew, called
"skouse," a loaf of soft bread, and coffee. For
supper, we had slices of corned-beef which the
sailors called "salt horse," hardtack, and tea.
The principal variation in this diet was in the
soups.</p>

<p>The days were a round of barley soup, bean
soup, pea soup, and back to barley soup again,
an alternation that led the men to speak of the
days of the week not as Monday, Tuesday, and
so on, but as "barley soup day," "bean soup
day," and "pea soup day." Once or twice a
week we had gingerbread for supper. On the
other hand the cabin fared sumptuously on
canned vegetables, meat, salmon, soft bread, tea,
and coffee with sugar and condensed milk, fresh
fish and meat whenever procurable, and a dessert
every day at dinner, including plum duff, a
famous sea delicacy which never in all the voyage
found its way forward.</p>

<p>From the first day, the green hands were set
learning the ropes, to stand lookout, to take their
trick at the wheel, to reef and furl and work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[ 36 ]</a></span>
among the sails. These things are the A B C of
seamanship, but they are not to be learned in a
day or a week. A ship is a complicated mechanism,
and it takes a long time for a novice to acquire
even the rudiments of sea education. Going
aloft was a terrifying ordeal at first to several
of the green hands, though it never bothered me.
When the cowboy was first ordered to furl the
fore-royal, he hung back and said, "I can't"
and "I'll fall," and whimpered and begged to
be let off. But he was forced to try. He
climbed the ratlines slowly and painfully to the
royal yard, and he finally furled the sail, though
it took him a long time to do it. He felt so
elated that after that he wanted to furl the royal
every time it had to be done;&mdash;didn't want to
give anyone else a chance.</p>

<p>Furling the royal was a one-man job. The
foot-rope was only a few feet below the yard,
and if a man stood straight on it, the yard would
strike him a little above the knees. If the ship
were pitching, a fellow had to look sharp or he
would be thrown off;&mdash;if that had happened it
was a nice, straight fall of eighty feet to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[ 37 ]</a></span>
deck. My own first experience on the royal
yard gave me an exciting fifteen minutes. The
ship seemed to be fighting me and devoting an
unpleasant amount of time and effort to it; bucking
and tossing as if with a sentient determination
to shake me off into the atmosphere. I escaped
becoming a grease spot on the deck of the
brig only by hugging the yard as if it were a
sweetheart and hanging on for dear life. I became
in time quite an expert at furling the sail.</p>

<p>Standing lookout was the one thing aboard a
green hand could do as well as an old sailor. The
lookout was posted on the forecastle-head in fair
weather and on the try-works in a storm. He
stood two hours at a stretch. He had to scan
the sea ahead closely and if a sail or anything
unusual appeared, he reported to the officer of
the watch.</p>

<p>Learning to steer by the compass was comparatively
easy. With the ship heading on a
course, it was not difficult by manipulating the
wheel to keep the needle of the compass on a
given point. But to steer by the wind was hard
to learn and is sometimes a nice matter even for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[ 38 ]</a></span>
skillful seamen. When a ship is close-hauled
and sailing, as sailors say, right in the wind's
eye, the wind is blowing into the braced sails at
the weather edge of the canvas;&mdash;if the vessel
were brought any higher up, the wind would
pour around on the back of the sails. The helmsman's
aim is to keep the luff of the royal sail or
of the sails that happen to be set, wrinkling and
loose&mdash;luffing, sailors call it. That shows that
the wind is slanting into the sails at just the
right angle and perhaps a little bit is spilling
over. I gradually learned to do this in the daytime.
But at night when it was almost impossible
for me to see the luff of the sails clearly, it
was extremely difficult and I got into trouble
more than once by my clumsiness. The trick at
the wheel was of two hours' duration.</p>

<p>The second day out from San Francisco was
Christmas. I had often read that Christmas was
a season of good cheer and happiness among
sailors at sea, that it was commemorated with
religious service, and that the skipper sent forward
grog and plum duff to gladden the hearts
of the sailormen. But Santa Claus forgot the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[ 39 ]</a></span>
sailors on the brig. Bean soup only distinguished
Christmas from the day that had gone
before and the day that came after. No liquor
or tempting dishes came to the forecastle. It
was the usual day of hard work from dawn to
dark.</p>

<p>After two weeks of variable weather during
which we were often becalmed, we put into Turtle
bay, midway down the coast of Lower California,
and dropped anchor.</p>

<p>Turtle bay is a beautiful little land-locked
harbor on an uninhabited coast. There was no
village or any human habitation on its shores.
A desolate, treeless country, seamed by gullies
and scantily covered with sun-dried grass, rolled
away to a chain of high mountains which forms
the backbone of the peninsula of Lower California.
These mountains were perhaps thirty
miles from the coast; they were gray and apparently
barren of trees or any sort of herbage, and
looked to be ridges of naked granite. The desert
character of the landscape was a surprise,
as we were almost within the tropics.</p>

<p>We spent three weeks of hard work in Turtle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[ 40 ]</a></span>
bay. Sea watches were abolished and all hands
were called on deck at dawn and kept busy until
sundown. The experienced sailors were employed
as sail makers; squatting all day on the
quarter-deck, sewing on canvas with a palm and
needle. Old sails were sent down from the spars
and patched and repaired. If they were too far
gone, new sails were bent in their stead. The
green hands had the hard work. They broke
out the hold and restowed every piece of cargo,
arranging it so that the vessel rode on a perfectly
even keel. Yards and masts were slushed,
the rigging was tarred, and the ship was painted
inside and out.</p>

<p>The waters of the harbor were alive with Spanish
mackerel, albacore, rock bass, bonitos, and
other kinds of fish. The mackerel appeared in
great schools that rippled the water as if a strong
breeze were blowing. These fish attracted great
numbers of gray pelicans, which had the most
wonderful mode of flight I have ever seen in any
bird. For hours at a time, with perfectly motionless
pinions, they skimmed the surface of
the bay like living aeroplanes; one wondered
wherein lay their motor power and how they
managed to keep going. When they spied a
school of mackerel, they rose straight into the
air with a great flapping of wings, then turned
their heads downward, folded their wings close
to their bodies, and dropped like a stone. Their
great beaks cut the water, they went under with
a terrific splash, and immediately emerged with
a fish in the net-like membrane beneath their
lower mandible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[ 41 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Every Sunday, a boat's crew went fishing.
We fished with hand lines weighted with lead
and having three or four hooks, baited at first
with bacon and later with pieces of fresh fish.
I never had such fine fishing. The fish bit as
fast as we could throw in our lines, and we were
kept busy hauling them out of the water. We
would fill a whale boat almost to the gunwales
in a few hours. With the return of the first fishing
expedition, the sailors had dreams of a feast,
but they were disappointed. The fish went to
the captain's table or were salted away in barrels
for the cabin's future use. The sailors, however,
enjoyed the fun. Many of them kept lines constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[ 42 ]</a></span>
over the brig's sides, catching skates,
soles, and little sharks.</p>

<p>By the time we reached Turtle bay, it was no
longer a secret that we would get only a dollar
for our year's voyage. As a result, a feverish
spirit of discontent began to manifest itself
among those forward and plans to run away
became rife.</p>

<p>We were anchored about a half mile from
shore, and after looking over the situation, I
made up my mind to try to escape. Except for
an officer and a boatsteerer who stood watch, all
hands were asleep below at night. Being a good
swimmer, I planned to slip over the bow in the
darkness and swim ashore. Once on land, I figured
it would be an easy matter to cross the
Sierras and reach a Mexican settlement on the
Gulf of California.</p>

<p>Possibly the officers got wind of the runaway
plots brewing in the forecastle, for Captain
Winchester came forward one evening, something
he never had done before, and fell into gossipy
talk with the men.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed that pile of stones with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[ 43 ]</a></span>
cross sticking in it on the harbor head?" he asked
in a casual sort of way.</p>

<p>Yes, we had all noticed it from the moment
we dropped anchor, and had wondered what it
was.</p>

<p>"That," said the captain impressively, "is a
grave. Whaling vessels have been coming to
Turtle bay for years to paint ship and overhaul.
Three sailors on a whaler several years ago
thought this was a likely place in which to escape.
They managed to swim ashore at night
and struck into the hills. They expected to find
farms and villages back inland. They didn't
know that the whole peninsula of Lower California
is a waterless desert from one end to the
other. They had some food with them and they
kept going for days. No one knows how far
inland they traveled, but they found neither inhabitants
nor water and their food was soon
gone.</p>

<p>"When they couldn't stand it any longer and
were half dying from thirst and hunger, they
turned back for the coast. By the time they returned
to Turtle bay their ship had sailed away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44 ]</a></span>
and there they were on a desert shore without
food or water and no way to get either. I suppose
they camped on the headland in the hope of
hailing a passing ship. But the vessels that pass
up and down this coast usually keep out of sight
of land. Maybe the poor devils sighted a distant
topsail&mdash;no one knows&mdash;but if they did the
ship sank beyond the horizon without paying any
attention to their frantic signals. So they died
miserably there on the headland.</p>

<p>"Next year, a whale ship found their bodies
and erected a cairn of stones marked by the cross
you see over the spot where the three sailors
were buried together. This is a bad country to
run away in," the captain added. "No food, no
water, no inhabitants. It's sure death for a runaway."</p>

<p>Having spun this tragic yarn, Captain Winchester
went aft again, feeling, no doubt, that he
had sowed seed on fertile soil. The fact is his
story had an instant effect. Most of the men
abandoned their plans to escape, at least for the
time being, hoping a more favorable opportunity
would present itself when we reached the Hawaiian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45 ]</a></span>
islands. But I had my doubts. I thought
it possible the captain merely had "put over"
a good bluff.</p>

<p>Next day I asked Little Johnny, the boatsteerer,
if it were true as the captain had said,
that Lower California was an uninhabited desert.
He assured me it was and to prove it, he brought
out a ship's chart from the cabin and spread it
before me. I found that only two towns
throughout the length and breadth of the peninsula
were set down on the map. One of these
was Tia Juana on the west coast just south of
the United States boundary line and the other
was La Paz on the east coast near Cape St.
Lucas, the southern tip of the peninsula. Turtle
bay was two or three hundred miles from
either town.</p>

<p>That settled it with me. I didn't propose to
take chances on dying in the desert. I preferred
a whaler's forecastle to that.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">TURTLES AND PORPOISES</p>


<p>We slipped out of Turtle bay one moonlight
night and stood southward. We
were now in sperm whale waters and the
crews of the whale boats were selected. Captain
Winchester was to head the starboard boat;
Mr. Landers the larboard boat; and Gabriel the
waist boat. Long John was to act as boatsteerer
for Mr. Winchester, Little Johnny for
Mr. Landers, and Mendez for Gabriel. The
whale boats were about twenty-five feet long,
rigged with leg-of-mutton sails and jibs. The
crew of each consisted of an officer known as a
boat-header, who sat in the stern and wielded the
tiller; a boatsteerer or harpooner, whose position
was in the bow; and four sailors who pulled the
stroke, midship, tub, and bow oars. Each boat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[ 47 ]</a></span>
had a tub in which four hundred fathoms of
whale line were coiled and carried two harpoons
and a shoulder bomb-gun. I was assigned to
the midship oar of Gabriel's boat.</p>

<p>Let me take occasion just here to correct a
false impression quite generally held regarding
whaling. Many persons&mdash;I think, most persons&mdash;have
an idea that in modern whaling, harpoons
are fired at whales from the decks of ships.
This is true only of 'long-shore whaling. In this
trade, finbacks and the less valuable varieties of
whales are chased by small steamers which fire
harpoons from guns in the bows and tow the
whales they kill to factories along shore, where
blubber, flesh, and skeleton are turned into commercial
products. Many published articles have
familiarized the public with this method of whaling.
But whaling on the sperm grounds of the
tropics and on the right whale and bowhead
grounds of the polar seas is much the same as it
has always been. Boats still go on the backs of
whales. Harpoons are thrown by hand into the
great animals as of yore. Whales still run away
with the boats, pulling them with amazing speed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[ 48 ]</a></span>
through walls of split water. Whales still crush
boats with blows of their mighty flukes and spill
their crews into the sea.</p>

<p>There is just as much danger and just as much
thrill and excitement in the whaling of to-day
as there was in that of a century ago. Neither
steamers nor sailing vessels that cruise for sperm
and bowhead and right whales nowadays have
deck guns of any sort, but depend entirely upon
the bomb-guns attached to harpoons and upon
shoulder bomb-guns wielded from the whale
boats.</p>

<p>In the old days, after whales had been harpooned,
they were stabbed to death with long,
razor-sharp lances. The lance is a thing of the
past. The tonite bomb has taken its place as an
instrument of destruction. In the use of the
tonite bomb lies the chief difference between modern
whaling and the whaling of the old school.</p>

<p>The modern harpoon is the same as it has been
since the palmy days of the old South Sea sperm
fisheries. But fastened on its iron shaft between
the wooden handle and the spear point is a brass
cylinder an inch in diameter, perhaps, and about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[ 49 ]</a></span>
a foot long. This cylinder is a tonite bomb-gun.
A short piece of metal projects from the flat
lower end. This is the trigger. When the harpoon
is thrown into the buttery, blubber-wrapped
body of the whale, it sinks in until the
whale's skin presses the trigger up into the gun
and fires it with a tiny sound like the explosion
of an old-fashioned shotgun cap. An instant
later a tonite bomb explodes with a muffled roar
in the whale's vitals.</p>

<p>The Arctic Ocean whaling fleet which sails out
of San Francisco and which in the year of my
voyage numbered thirty vessels, makes its spring
rendezvous in the Hawaiian Islands. Most of
the ships leave San Francisco in December and
reach Honolulu in March. The two or three
months spent in this leisurely voyage are known
in whaler parlance as "between seasons." On
the way to the islands the ships cruise for sperm
whales and sometimes lower for finbacks, sulphur-bottoms,
California grays, and even black
fish, to practice their green hand crews.</p>

<p>Captain Winchester did not care particularly
whether he took any sperm whales or not, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[ 50 ]</a></span>
sperm oil is still valuable. The brig was not
merely a blubber-hunter. Her hold was filled
with oil tanks which it was hoped would be filled
before we got back, but the chief purpose of the
voyage was the capture of right and bowhead
whales&mdash;the great baleen whales of the North.</p>

<p>As soon as we left Turtle Bay, a lookout for
whales was posted. During the day watches, a
boatsteerer and a sailor sat on the topsail yard
for two hours at a stretch and scanned the sea
for spouts. We stood down the coast of Lower
California and in a few days, were in the tide-rip
which is always running off Cape St. Lucas,
where the waters of the Pacific meet a counter-current
from the Gulf of California. We
rounded Cape St. Lucas and sailed north into
the gulf, having a distant view of La Paz, a
little town backed by gray mountains. Soon we
turned south again, keeping close to the Mexican
coast for several days. I never learned how far
south we went, but we must have worked pretty
well toward the equator, for when we stood out
across the Pacific for the Hawaiian Islands, our
course was northwesterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[ 51 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw my first whales one morning while working
in the bows with the watch under Mr. Lander's
supervision. A school of finbacks was out
ahead moving in leisurely fashion toward the
brig. There were about twenty of them and the
sea was dotted with their fountains. "Blow!"
breathed old man Landers with mild interest as
though to himself. "Blow!" boomed Captain
Winchester in his big bass voice from the quarter-deck.
"Nothin' but finbacks, sir," shouted the
boatsteerer from the mast-head. "All right,"
sang back the captain. "Let 'em blow." It
was easy for these old whalers even at this distance
to tell they were not sperm whales. Their
fountains rose straight into the air. A sperm
whale's spout slants up from the water diagonally.</p>

<p>The whales were soon all about the ship, seemingly
unafraid, still traveling leisurely, their
heads rising and falling rhythmically, and at each
rise blowing up a fountain of mist fifteen feet
high. The fountains looked like water; some
water surely was mixed with them; but I was
told that the mist was the breath of the animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[ 52 ]</a></span>
made visible by the colder air. The breath came
from the blow holes in a sibilant roar that resembled
no sound I had ever heard. If one can imagine
a giant of fable snoring in his sleep, one
may have an idea of the sound of the mighty exhalation.
The great lungs whose gentle breathing
could shoot a jet of spray fifteen feet into
the air must have had the power of enormous
bellows.</p>

<p>Immense coal-black fellows these finbacks
were&mdash;some at least sixty or seventy feet long.
One swam so close to the brig that when he blew,
the spray fell all about me, wetting my clothes
like dew. The finback is a baleen whale and a
cousin of the right whale and the bowhead. Their
mouths are edged with close-set slabs of baleen,
which, however, is so short that it is worthless for
commercial purposes. They are of much slenderer
build than the more valuable species of
whale. Their quickness and activity make them
dangerous when hunted in the boats, but their
bodies are encased in blubber so thin that it is
as worthless as their bone. Consequently they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[ 53 ]</a></span>
are not hunted unless a whaling ship is hard up
for oil.</p>

<p>We gradually worked into the trade winds that
blew steadily from the southeast. These winds
stayed with us for several weeks or rather we
stayed with the winds; while in them it was rarely
necessary to take in or set a sail or brace a yard.
After we had passed through these aerial rivers,
flowing through definite, if invisible, banks, we
struck the doldrums&mdash;areas of calm between
wind currents&mdash;they might be called whirlpools
of stillness. Later in the day light, fitful breezes
finally pushed us through them into the region
of winds again.</p>

<p>The slow voyage to the Hawaiian islands&mdash;on
the sperm whale grounds, we cruised under
short sail&mdash;might have proved monotonous if we
had not been kept constantly busy and if diverting
incidents had not occurred almost every day.
Once we sighted three immense turtles sunning
themselves on the sea. To the captain they held
out prospect of soups and delicate dishes for the
cabin table, and with Long John as boatsteerer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[ 54 ]</a></span>
a boat was lowered for them. I expected it
would be difficult to get within darting distance.
What was my surprise to see the turtles, with
heads in the air and perfectly aware of their danger,
remain upon the surface until the boat was
directly upon them. The fact was they could
not go under quickly; the big shells kept them
afloat. Long John dropped his harpoon crashing
through the shell of one of the turtles, flopped
it into the boat, and then went on without particular
hurry, and captured the other two in the
same way. The cabin feasted for several days on
the delicate flesh of the turtles; the forecastle got
only a savory smell from the galley, as was usual.</p>

<p>We ran into a school of porpoises on another
occasion&mdash;hundreds of them rolling and tumbling
about the ship, like fat porkers on a frolic.
Little Johnny took a position on the forecastle
head with a harpoon, the line from which had
been made fast to the fore-bitt. As a porpoise
rose beneath him, he darted his harpoon straight
into its back. The sea pig went wriggling under,
leaving the water dyed with its blood. It was
hauled aboard, squirming and twisting. Little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[ 55 ]</a></span>
Johnny harpooned two more before the school
took fright and disappeared. The porpoises
were cleaned and some of their meat, nicely
roasted, was sent to the forecastle. It made fine
eating, tasting something like beef.</p>

<p>The steward was an inveterate fisherman and
constantly kept a baited hook trailing in the brig's
wake, the line tied to the taff-rail. He caught
a great many bonitos and one day landed a dolphin.
We had seen many of these beautiful fish
swimming about the ship&mdash;long, graceful and
looking like an animate streak of blue sky. The
steward's dolphin was about five feet long. I
had often seen in print the statement that dolphins
turned all colors of the rainbow in dying
and I had as often seen the assertion branded
as a mere figment of poetic imagination. Our
dolphin proved the truth of the poetic tradition.
As life departed, it changed from blue to green,
bronze, salmon, gold, and gray, making death as
beautiful as a gorgeous kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>We saw flying fish every day&mdash;great "coveys"
of them, one may say. They frequently flew
several hundred yards, fluttering their webbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[ 56 ]</a></span>
side fins like the wings of a bird, sometimes rising
fifteen to twenty feet above the water, and curving
and zigzagging in their flight. More than
once they flew directly across the ship and several
fell on deck. I was talking with Kaiuli, the
Kanaka, one night when we heard a soft little
thud on deck. I should have paid no attention
but Kaiuli was alert on the instant. "Flying
feesh," he cried zestfully and rushed off to search
the deck. He found the fish and ate it raw,
smacking his lips over it with great gusto. The
Hawaiian islanders, he told me, esteem raw flying
fish a great delicacy.</p>

<p>I never saw water so "darkly, deeply, beautifully
blue" as in the middle of the Pacific where
we had some four miles of water under us. It
was as blue as indigo. At night, the sea seemed
afire with riotous phosphorescence. White
flames leaped about the bows where the brig cut
the water before a fresh breeze; the wake was a
broad, glowing path. When white caps were
running every wave broke in sparks and tongues
of flame, and the ocean presented the appearance
of a prairie swept by fire. A big shark came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[ 57 ]</a></span>
swimming about the ship one night and it shone
like a living incandescence&mdash;a silent, ghost-like
shape slowly gliding under the brig and out
again.</p>

<p>The idle night watches in the tropics were
great times for story telling. The deep-water
sailors were especially fond of this way of passing
the time. While the green hands were engaging
in desultory talk and wishing for the bell
to strike to go back to their bunks, these deep-water
fellows would be pacing up and down or
sitting on deck against the bulwarks, smoking
their pipes and spinning yarns to each other.
The stories as a rule were interminable and were
full of "Then he says" and "Then the other fellow
says." It was a poor story that did not last
out a four-hour watch and many of them were
regular "continued in our next" serials, being
cut short at the end of one watch to be resumed
in the next.</p>

<p>No matter how long-winded or prosy the narrative,
the story teller was always sure of an audience
whose attention never flagged for an instant.
The boyish delight of these full-grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[ 58 ]</a></span>
men in stories amazed me. I had never seen
anything like it. Once in a while a tale was told
that was worth listening to, but most of them were
monotonously uninteresting. They bored me.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THE A, B, C OF WHALES</p>


<p>One damp morning, with frequent showers
falling here and there over the sea and not
a drop wetting the brig, Captain Winchester
suddenly stopped pacing up and down
the weather side of the quarter-deck, threw his
head up into the wind, and sniffed the air.</p>

<p>"There's sperm whale about as sure as I live,"
he said to Mr. Landers. "I smell 'em."</p>

<p>Mr. Landers inhaled the breeze through his
nose in jerky little sniffs.</p>

<p>"No doubt about it," he replied. "You could
cut the smell with a knife."</p>

<p>I was at the wheel and overheard this talk. I
smiled. These old sea dogs, I supposed, were
having a little joke. The skipper saw the grin
on my face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[ 60 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph, you don't believe I smell whale,
eh?" he said. "I can smell whale like a bird
dog smells quail. Take a sniff at the wind.
Can't you smell it yourself?"</p>

<p>I gave a few hopeful sniffs.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I can't smell anything unless,
perhaps, salt water."</p>

<p>"You've got a poor smeller," returned the captain.
"The wind smells rank and oily. That
means sperm whale. If I couldn't smell it, I
could taste it. I'll give you a plug of tobacco,
if we don't raise sperm before dark."</p>

<p>He didn't have to pay the tobacco. Within
an hour, we raised a sperm whale spouting far
to windward and traveling in the same direction
as the brig. The captain hurried to the cabin
for his binoculars. As he swung himself into the
shrouds to climb to the mast-head, he shouted to
me, "Didn't I tell you I could smell 'em?" The
watch was called. The crew of the captain's
boat was left to work the ship and Mr. Landers
and Gabriel lowered in the larboard and waist
boats. Sails were run up and we went skimming
away on our first whale hunt. We had a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[ 61 ]</a></span>
beat to windward ahead of us and as the whale
was moving along at fair speed, remaining below
fifteen minutes or so between spouts, it was slow
work cutting down the distance that separated
us from it.</p>

<p>"See how dat spout slant up in de air?" remarked
old Gabriel whom the sight of our first
sperm had put in high good humor.</p>

<p>We looked to where the whale was blowing
and saw its fountain shoot into the air diagonally,
tufted with a cloudy spread of vapor at the top.</p>

<p>"You know why it don't shoot straight up?"</p>

<p>No one knew.</p>

<p>"Dat feller's blow hole in de corner ob his
square head&mdash;dat's why," said Gabriel. "He
blow his fountain out in front of him. Ain't no
udder kind o' whale do dat. All de udder kind
blow straight up. All de differ in de worl' between
dat sperm whale out dere and de bowhead
and right whale up nort'. Ain't shaped nothin'
a-tall alike. Bowhead and right whale got big
curved heads and big curved backs. Sperm
whale's about one-third head and his back ain't
got no bow to it&mdash;not much&mdash;jest lies straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[ 62 ]</a></span>
out behind his head. He look littler in de water
dan de right and bowhead whale. But he ain't.
He's as big as de biggest whale dat swims de sea.
I've seen a 150 barrel sperm dat measure seventy
feet.</p>

<p>"Blow!" added the old negro as he caught
sight of the whale spouting again.</p>

<p>"Bowhead and right whale got no teeth," he
continued. "Dey got only long slabs o' baleen
hung wit' hair in de upper jaw. Sperm whale
got teeth same as you and me&mdash;about twenty on
a side and all in his lower jaw. Ain't got no
teeth in his upper jaw a-tall. His mouth is white
inside and his teeth stand up five or six inches
out o' his gums and are wide apart and sharp
and pointed and look jes' like de teeth of a saw.
Wen he open his mouth, his lower jaw fall
straight down and his mouth's big enough to
take a whale boat inside.</p>

<p>"Sperm whale's fightin' whale. He fight wit'
his tail and his teeth. He knock a boat out de
water wit' his flukes and he scrunch it into kindlin'
wood wit' his teeth. He's got fightin' sense
too&mdash;he's sly as a fox. W'en I was young feller,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[ 63 ]</a></span>
I was in de sperm trade mysel' and used to
ship out o' New Bedford round Cape o' Good
Hope for sperm whale ground in Indian Ocean
and Sout' Pacific. Once I go on top a sperm
whale in a boat an' he turn flukes and lash out
wit' his tail but miss us. Den he bring up his
old head and take a squint back at us out o' his
foxy little eye and begin to slew his body roun'
till he get his tail under de boat. But de boatheader
too smart fer him and we stern oars and
get out o' reach. But de whale didn't know we
done backed out o' reach and w'en he bring up
dat tail it shoot out o' de water like it was shot
out o' a cannon. Mighty fine fer us he miss us
dat time.</p>

<p>"But dat don't discourage dat whale a-tall.
He swim round and slew round and sight at us
out o' his eye and at las' he get under de boat.
Den he lift it on de tip o' his tail sky-high and
pitch us all in de water. Dat was jes' what he
been working for. He swim away and turn round
and come shootin' back straight fer dat boat and
w'en he get to it, he crush it wit' his teeth and
chew it up and shake his head like a mad bulldog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64 ]</a></span>
until dere warn't nothin' left of dat boat but a
lot o' kindlin' wood. But dat warn't all. He
swim to a man who wuz lying across an oar to
keep afloat and he chew dat man up and spit
him out in li'l pieces and we ain't never see
nothin' o' dat feller again.</p>

<p>"Guess that whale was goin' to give us all de
same medicine, but he ain't have time. De udder
boats come up and fill him full o' harpoons
and keep stickin' der lances into him and kill
him right where he lays and he never had no
chance to scoff the rest o' us. But if it ain't fer
dem boats, I guess dat feller eat us all jes' like
plum duff. Sperm whale, some fighter, believe
me.</p>

<p>"Dere he white waters&mdash;blow!" added Gabriel
as the whale came to the surface again.</p>

<p>"Sperm whale try out de bes' oil," the garrulous
old whaleman went on. "Bowhead and
right whale got thicker blubber and make more
oil, but sperm whale oil de bes'. He got big
cistern&mdash;what dey call a 'case'&mdash;in de top ob
his head and it's full o' spermaceti, sloshing about
in dere and jes' as clear as water. His old head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[ 65 ]</a></span>
is always cut off and hoist on deck to bale out
dat case. Many times dey find ambergrease
(ambergis) floating beside a dead sperm whale.
It's solid and yellowish and stuck full o' cuttle
feesh beaks dat de whale's done swallowed but
ain't digest. Dey makes perfume out o' dat ambergrease
and it's worth its weight in gold. I've
offen seen it in chunks dat weighed a hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>"You see a sperm whale ain't eat nothin' but
cuttle feesh&mdash;giant squid, dey calls 'em, or devil
feesh. Dey certainly is terrible fellers&mdash;is dem
devil feesh. Got arms twenty or thirty feet long
wit' sucking discs all over 'em and a big fat body
in de middle ob dese snaky arms, wit' big pop-eyes
as big as water buckets and a big black beak
like a parrot's to tear its food wit'. Dose devil
feesh. Dey certainly is terrible fellers&mdash;is dem
sperm whale nose 'em out and eat 'em. Some
time dey comes to de top and de whale and de
cuttle feesh fights it out. I've hearn old whalers
say dey seen fights between sperm whale and
cuttle feesh but I ain't never seen dat and I
reckon mighty few fellers ever did. But when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66 ]</a></span>
a sperm whale is killed, he spews out chunks o'
cuttle feesh and I've seen de water about a dead
sperm thick wit' white chunks of cuttle feesh as
big as a sea ches' and wit' de suckin' disc still
on 'em.</p>

<p>"Blow!" said Gabriel again with his eyes on
the whale. "Dat feesh certainly some traveler."</p>

<p>We were hauling closer to the whale. I could
see it distinctly by this time and could note how
square and black its head was. Its appearance
might be compared not inaptly to a box-car glistening
in the sun under a fresh coat of black
paint. It did not cut the water but pushed it in
white foam in front of it.</p>

<p>"Sperm pretty scarce nowadays," Gabriel resumed.
"Nothing like as plentiful in Pacific
waters as dey used to be in de ole days. Whalers
done pretty well thinned 'em out. But long
ago, it used to be nothin' to see schools of a
hundred, mostly cows wit' three or four big bulls
among 'em."</p>

<p>"Any difference between a bowhead and a
right whale?" some one asked.</p>

<p>"O good Lord, yes," answered Gabriel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67 ]</a></span>
"Big difference. Right whale thinner whale dan
a bowhead, ain't got sech thick blubber neither.
He's quicker in de water and got nothin' like
such long baleen. You ketch right whale in
Behring Sea. I ain't never see none in de Arctic
Ocean. You ketch bowhead both places.
Right whale fightin' feesh, too, but he ain't so
dangerous as a sperm."</p>

<p>Let me add that I give this statement of the
old whaleman for what it is worth. All books
I have ever read on the subject go on the theory
that the Greenland or right whale is the same
animal as the bowhead. We lowered for a right
whale later in the voyage in Behring Sea. To
my untrained eyes, it looked like a bowhead
which we encountered every few days while on
the Arctic Ocean whaling grounds. But there
was no doubt or argument about it among the
old whalemen aboard. To them it was a "right
whale" and nothing else. Old Gabriel may
have known what he was talking about. Despite
the naturalists, whalers certainly make a
pronounced distinction.</p>

<p>By the time Gabriel had imparted all this information,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[ 68 ]</a></span>
we had worked to within a half mile
of our whale which was still steaming along at
the rate of knots. They say a sperm whale has
ears so small they are scarcely detected, but it
has a wonderfully keen sense of hearing for all
that. Our whale must have heard us or seen us.
At any rate it bade us a sudden good-bye and
scurried off unceremoniously over the rim of the
world. The boats kept on along the course it
was heading for over an hour, but the whale never
again favored us with so much as a distant spout.
Finally signals from the brig's mast-head summoned
us aboard.</p>

<p>As the men had had no practice in the boats
before, both boats lowered sail and we started to
row back to the vessel. We had pulled about
a mile when Mendez, who was acting as boatsteerer,
said quietly, "Blow! Blackfish dead
ahead."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," replied Gabriel. "Now stand
by, Tomas. I'll jes' lay you aboard one o' dem
blackfeesh and we'll teach dese green fellers
somethin' 'bout whalin'."</p>

<p>There were about fifty blackfish in the school.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[ 69 ]</a></span>
They are a species of small toothed whale, from
ten to twenty feet long, eight or ten feet in circumference
and weighing two or three tons.
They were gamboling and tumbling like porpoises.
Their black bodies flashed above the surface
in undulant curves and I wondered if, when
seen at a distance, these little cousins of the sperm
had not at some time played their part in establishing
the myth of the sea serpent.</p>

<p>"Get ready, Tomas," said Gabriel as we drew
near the school.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," responded Mendez.</p>

<p>Pulling away as hard as we could, we shot
among the blackfish. Mendez selected a big one
and drove his harpoon into its back. Almost at
the same time Mr. Lander's boat became fast to
another. Our fish plunged and reared half out
of water, rolled and splashed about, finally shot
around in a circle and died. Mr. Lander's fish
was not fatally hit and when it became apparent
it would run away with a tub of line, Little
Johnny, the boatsteerer, cut adrift and let it go.
Mendez cut our harpoon free and left our fish
weltering on the water. Blackfish yield a fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[ 70 ]</a></span>
good quality of oil, but one was too small a catch
to potter with. Our adventure among the blackfish
was merely practice for the boat crews to
prepare them for future encounters with the
monarchs of the deep.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THE NIGHT KING</p>


<p>The crew called Tomas Mendez, the acting
third mate, the "Night King." I have
forgotten what forecastle poet fastened the
name upon him, but it fitted like a glove. In
the day watches when the captain and mate were
on deck, he was only a quite, unobtrusive little
negro, insignificant in size and with a bad case
of rheumatism. But at night when the other officers
were snoring in their bunks below and the
destinies of the brig were in his hands, he became
an autocrat who ruled with a hand of
iron.</p>

<p>He was as black as a bowhead's skin&mdash;a lean,
scrawny, sinewy little man, stooped about the
shoulders and walking with a slight limp. His
countenance was imperious. His lips were thin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[ 72 ]</a></span>
and cruel. His eyes were sharp and sinister.
His ebony skin was drawn so tightly over the
frame-work of his face that it almost seemed as
if it would crack when he smiled. His nose had
a domineering Roman curve. He carried his
head high. In profile, this little blackamoor
suggested the mummified head of some old Pharaoh.</p>

<p>He was a native of the Cape Verde islands.
He spoke English with the liquid burr of a Latin.
His native tongue was Portuguese. No glimmer
of education relieved his mental darkness.
It was as though his outside color went all the
way through. He could neither read nor write,
but he was a good sailor and no better whaleman
ever handled a harpoon or laid a boat on a whale's
back. For twenty years he had been sailing as
boatsteerer on whale ships, and to give the devil
his due, he had earned a name for skill and
courage in a thousand adventures among sperm,
bowhead, and right whales in tropical and frozen
seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[ 73 ]</a></span></p>

<p>My first impression of the Night King stands
out in my memory with cameo distinctness. In
the bustle and confusion of setting sails, just after
the tug had cut loose from us outside Golden
Gate heads, I saw Mendez, like an ebony statue,
standing in the waist of the ship, an arm resting
easily on the bulwarks, singing out orders
in a clear, incisive voice that had in it the ring
of steel.</p>

<p>When I shipped, it had not entered my mind
that any but white men would be of the ship's
company. It was with a shock like a blow in the
face that I saw this little colored man singing
out orders. I wondered in a dazed sort of way
if he was to be in authority over me. I was not
long in doubt. When calm had succeeded the
first confusion and the crew had been divided
into watches, Captain Winchester announced
from the break of the poop that "Mr." Mendez
would head the port watch. That was my
watch. While the captain was speaking, "Mr."
Mendez stood like a black Napoleon and surveyed
us long and silently. Then suddenly he
snapped out a decisive order and the white men
jumped to obey. The Night King had assumed
his throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[ 74 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The Night King and I disliked each other from
the start. It may seem petty now that it's all
past, but I raged impotently in the bitterness of
outraged pride at being ordered about by this
black overlord of the quarter-deck. He was not
slow to discover my smoldering resentment and
came to hate me with a cordiality not far from
classic. He kept me busy with some silly job
when the other men were smoking their pipes
and spinning yarns. If I showed the left-handedness
of a landlubber in sailorizing he made me
stay on deck my watch below to learn the ropes.
If there was dirt or litter to be shoveled overboard,
he sang out for me.</p>

<p>"Clean up dat muck dere, you," he would say
with fine contempt.</p>

<p>The climax of his petty tyrannies came one
night on the run to Honolulu when he charged
me with some trifling infraction of ship's rules,
of which I was not guilty, and ordered me aloft
to sit out the watch on the fore yard. The yard
was broad, the night was warm, the ship was traveling
on a steady keel, and physically the punishment
was no punishment at all. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[ 75 ]</a></span>
no particular ignominy in the thing, either, for
it was merely a joke to the sailors. The sting of
it was in having to take such treatment from this
small colored person without being able to resent
it or help myself.</p>

<p>The very next morning I was awakened by
the cry of the lookout on the topsail yard.</p>

<p>"Blow! Blow! There's his old head.
Blo&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;w! There he ripples. There goes
flukes." Full-lunged and clear, the musical cry
came from aloft like a song with little yodling
breaks in the measure. It was the view-halloo
of the sea, and it quickened the blood and set
the nerves tingling.</p>

<p>"Where away?" shouted the captain, rushing
from the cabin with his binoculars.</p>

<p>"Two points on the weather bow, sir," returned
the lookout.</p>

<p>For a moment nothing was to be seen but an
expanse of yeasty sea. Suddenly into the air
shot a fountain of white water&mdash;slender, graceful,
spreading into a bush of spray at the top.
A great sperm was disporting among the white
caps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[ 76 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Call all hands and clear away the boats,"
yelled the captain.</p>

<p>Larboard and waist boats were lowered from
the davits. Their crews scrambled over the ship's
side, the leg-o'-mutton sails were hoisted, and the
boats, bending over as the wind caught them,
sped away on the chase. The Night King went
as boatsteerer of the waist boat. I saw him
smiling to himself as he shook the kinks out of his
tub-line and laid his harpoons in position in the
bows&mdash;harpoons with no bomb-guns attached to
the spear-shanks.</p>

<p>In the distance, a slow succession of fountains
gleamed in the brilliant tropical sunshine like
crystal lamps held aloft on fairy pillars. Suddenly
the tell-tale beacons of spray went out.
The whale had sounded. Over the sea, the boats
quartered like baffled foxhounds to pick up the
lost trail.</p>

<p>Between the ship and the boats, the whale
came quietly to the surface at last and lay perfectly
still, taking its ease, sunning itself and
spouting lazily. The captain, perched in the
ship's cross-trees, signalled its position with flags,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[ 77 ]</a></span>
using a code familiar to whalemen. The Night
King caught the message first. He turned
quickly to the boatheader at the tiller and
pointed. Instantly the boat came about, the sailors
shifted from one gunwale to the other, the
big sail swung squarely out and filled. All hands
settled themselves for the run to close quarters.</p>

<p>With thrilling interest, I watched the hunt
from the ship's forward bulwarks, where I stood
grasping a shroud to prevent pitching overboard.
Down a long slant of wind, the boat ran free with
the speed of a greyhound, a white plume of spray
standing high on either bow. The Night King
stood alert and cool, one foot on the bow seat,
balancing a harpoon in his hands. The white
background of the bellying sail threw his tense
figure into relief. Swiftly, silently, the boat
stole upon its quarry until but one long sea lay
between. It rose upon the crest of the wave and
poised there for an instant like some great white-winged
bird of prey. Then sweeping down the
green slope, it struck the whale bows-on and
beached its keel out of the water on its glistening
back. As it struck, the Night King let fly one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[ 78 ]</a></span>
harpoon and another, driving them home up to
the wooden hafts with all the strength of his
lithe arms.</p>

<p>The sharp bite of the iron in its vitals stirred
the titanic mass of flesh and blood from perfect
stillness into a frenzy of sudden movement that
churned the water of the sea into white froth.
The great head went under, the giant back curved
down like the whirling surface of some mighty
fly-wheel, the vast flukes, like some black demon's
arm, shot into the air. Left and right and left
again, the great tail thrashed, smiting the sea
with thwacks which could have been heard for
miles. It struck the boat glancingly with its bare
tip, yet the blow stove a great hole in the bottom
timbers, lifted the wreck high in air, and sent the
sailors sprawling into the sea. Then the whale
sped away with the speed of a limited express.
It had not been vitally wounded. Over the distant
horizon, it passed out of sight, blowing up
against the sky fountains of clear water unmixed
with blood.</p>

<p>The other boat hurried to the rescue and the
crew gathered up the half-drowned sailors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[ 79 ]</a></span>
perched on the bottom of the upturned boat or
clinging to floating sweeps. Fouled in the rigging
of the sail, held suspended beneath the
wreck in the green crystal of the sea water, they
found the Night King, dead.</p>

<p>When the whale crushed the boat&mdash;at the very
moment, it must have been&mdash;the Night King had
snatched the knife kept fastened in a sheath on
the bow thwart and with one stroke of the razor
blade, severed the harpoon lines. He thus released
the whale and prevented it from dragging
the boat away in its mad race. The Night
King's last act had saved the lives of his companions.</p>

<p>I helped lift the body over the rail. We laid
it on the quarter deck near the skylight. It
lurched and shifted in a ghastly sort of way as
the ship rolled, the glazed eyes open to the blue
sky. The captain's Newfoundland dog came
and sniffed at the corpse. Sheltered from the
captain's eye behind the galley, the Kanaka cabin
boy shook a furtive fist at the dead man and
ground out between clenched teeth, "You black
devil, you'll never kick me again." Standing not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[ 80 ]</a></span>
ten feet away, the mate cracked a joke to the
second mate and the two laughed uproariously.
The work of the ship went on all around.</p>

<p>Looking upon the dead thing lying there, I
thought of the pride with which the living man
had borne himself in the days of his power. I
beheld in fancy the silent, lonely, imperious little
figure, pacing to and fro on the weather side
of the quarter-deck&mdash;to and fro under the stars.
I saw him stop in the darkness by the wheel,
as his custom was, to peer down into the lighted
binnacle and say in vibrant tones, "Keep her
steady," or "Let her luff." I saw him buttoned
up in his overcoat to keep the dew of the tropical
night from his rheumatic joints, slip down the
poop ladder and stump forward past the try-works
to see how things fared in the bow. Again
I heard his nightly cry to the lookout on the forecastle-head,
"Keep a bright lookout dere, you,"
and saw him limp back to continue his vigil,
pacing up and down. The qualities that had
made him hated when he was indeed the Night
King flooded back upon me, but I did not forget
the courage of my enemy that had redeemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[ 81 ]</a></span>
them all and made him a hero in the hour of
death.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, old Nelson sat on the deck
beside the corpse and with palm and needle fashioned
a long canvas bag. Into this the dead man
was sewed with a weight of brick and sand at his
feet.</p>

<p>At sunset, when all hands were on deck for the
dog watch, they carried the body down on the
main deck and with feet to the sea, laid it on
the gang-plank which had been removed from
the rail. There in the waist the ship's company
gathered with uncovered heads. Over all was
the light of the sunset, flushing the solemn, rough
faces and reddening the running white-caps of
the sea. The captain called me to him and
placed a Bible in my hands.</p>

<p>"Read a passage of scripture," he said.</p>

<p>Dumbfounded that I should be called upon to
officiate at the burial service over the man I had
hated, I took my stand on the main hatch at
the head of the body and prepared to obey orders.
No passage to fit my singular situation
occurred to me and I opened the book at random.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[ 82 ]</a></span>
The leaves fell apart at the seventh chapter of
Matthew and I read aloud the section beginning:</p>

<p>"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with
what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged;
and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
to you again."</p>

<p>At the close of the reading the captain called
for "The Sweet Bye and Bye" and the crew
sang the verses of the old hymn solemnly. When
the full-toned music ceased, two sailors tilted the
gang-plank upwards and the remains of the
Night King slid off and plunged into the ocean.</p>

<p>As the body slipped toward the water, a Kanaka
sailor caught up a bucket of slop which he
had set aside for the purpose, and dashed its
filth over the corpse from head to foot. Wide-eyed
with astonishment, I looked to see instant
punishment visited upon this South Sea heathen
who so flagrantly violated the sanctities of the
dead. But not a hand was raised, not a word of
disapproval was uttered. The Kanaka had but
followed a whaler's ancient custom. The parting
insult to the dead was meant to discourage
the ghost from ever coming back to haunt the
brig.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">DREAMS OF LIBERTY</p>


<p>At midnight after the burial, we raised the
volcanic fire of Mauna Loa dead ahead.
Sailors declare that a gale always follows
a death at sea and the wind that night blew hard.
But we cracked on sail and next morning we
were gliding in smooth water along the shore of
the island of Hawaii with the great burning
mountain towering directly over us and the
smoke from the crater swirling down through
our rigging.</p>

<p>We loafed away three pleasant weeks among
the islands, loitering along the beautiful sea
channels, merely killing time until Captain
Shorey should arrive from San Francisco by
steamer. Once we sailed within distant view of
Molokai. It was as beautiful in its tropical verdure
as any of the other islands of the group,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[ 84 ]</a></span>
but its very name was fraught with sinister and
tragic suggestiveness;&mdash;it was the home of the
lepers, the island of the Living Death.</p>

<p>We did not anchor at any time. None of the
whaling fleet which meets here every spring ever
anchors. The lure of the tropical shores is strong
and there would be many desertions if the ships
lay in port. We sailed close to shore in the day
time, often entering Honolulu harbor, but at
night we lay off and on, as the sailor term is&mdash;that
is we tacked off shore and back again, rarely
venturing closer than two or three miles, a distance
the hardiest swimmer, bent upon desertion,
would not be apt to attempt in those shark-haunted
waters.</p>

<p>Many attempts to escape from vessels of the
whaling fleet occur in the islands every year. We
heard many yarns of these adventures. A week
before we arrived, five sailors had overpowered
the night watch aboard their ship and escaped to
shore in a whale boat. They were captured in
the hills back of Honolulu and returned to their
vessel. This is usually the fate of runaways. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[ 85 ]</a></span>
standing reward of $25 a man is offered by whaling
ships for the capture and return of deserters,
consequently all the natives of the islands, especially
the police, are constantly on the lookout
for runaways from whaling crews.</p>

<p>When we drew near the islands the runaway
fever became epidemic in the forecastle. Each
sailor had his own little scheme for getting away.
Big Taylor talked of knocking the officers of
the night watch over the head with a belaying-pin
and stealing ashore in a boat. Ole Oleson cut
up his suit of oil-skins and sewed them into two
air-tight bags with one of which under each arm,
he proposed to float ashore. Bill White, an
Englishman, got possession of a lot of canvas
from the cabin and was clandestinely busy for
days making it into a boat in which he fondly
hoped to paddle ashore some fine night in the
dark of the moon. "Slim," our Irish grenadier,
stuffed half his belongings into his long sea-boots
which he planned to press into service both as
carry-alls and life-preservers. Peter Swenson,
the forecastle's baby boy, plugged up some big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[ 86 ]</a></span>
empty oil cans and made life buoys of them by
fastening a number of them together.</p>

<p>Just at the time when the forecastle conspiracies
were at their height we killed a thirteen-foot
shark off Diamond Head. Our catch was
one of a school of thirty or forty monsters that
came swarming about the brig, gliding slowly
like gray ghosts only a few feet below the surface,
nosing close to the ship's side for garbage
and turning slightly on their sides to look out of
their evil eyes at the sailors peering down upon
them over the rail. Long John, the boat-steerer,
got out a harpoon, and standing on the bulwarks
shot the iron up to the wooden haft into the
back of one of the sharks, the spear-point of the
weapon passing through the creature and sticking
out on the under side. The stout manila
hemp attached to the harpoon had been made
fast to the fore bitt. It was well that this was
so, for the shark plunged and fought with terrific
fury, lashing the sea into white froth. But the
harpoon had pierced a vital part and in a little
while the great fish ceased its struggles and lay
still, belly up on the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[ 87 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It was hauled close alongside, and a boat having
been lowered, a large patch of the shark's
skin was cut off. Then the carcass was cut
adrift. The skin was as rough as sandpaper. It
was cut into small squares, which were used in
scouring metal and for all the polishing purposes
for which sandpaper serves ashore.</p>

<p>Life aboard the brig seemed less intolerable
thereafter, and an essay at escape through
waters infested by such great, silent, ravenous
sea-wolves seemed a hazard less desirable than
before. Taylor talked no more about slugging
the night watch. Slim unpacked his sea-boots
and put his effects back into his chest. Peter
threw his plugged oil cans overboard. Bill
White turned his canvas boat into curtains for
his bunk, and Ole Oleson voiced in the lilting
measure of Scandinavia his deep regret that he
had cut up a valuable suit of oil-skins.</p>

<p>The captain of one of the whaling ships came
one afternoon to visit our skipper and his small
boat was left dragging in our wake as the brig
skimmed along under short sail. It occurred to
me, and at the same time to my two Kanaka
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88 ]</a></span>
shipmates, that here was a fine opportunity to
escape. It was coming on dusk, and if we could
get into the boat and cut loose we might have a
splendid chance to get away. The Kanakas and
I climbed over the bow, intending to let ourselves
into the sea and drift astern to the boat,
but the breeze had freshened and the brig was
traveling so fast we did not believe we could
catch the boat; and if we failed to do so, we
might confidently expect the sharks to finish us.
We abandoned the plan after we had remained
squatting on the stays over the bow for a half
hour considering our chances and getting soaked
to the skin from the dashing spray.</p>

<p>A pathetic incident grew out of the visit of
the captain from the other ship. Tomas Mendez's
brother, a boat-steerer, came aboard with
the boat's crew. He was a young negro whom
all the boat-steerers and officers knew. He came
swinging lightly over our rail, laughing and
happy over the prospect of seeing his brother.</p>

<p>"Hello, fellers," he called to the Portuguese
officers and boat-steerers who welcomed him.
"Where's my brudder?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[ 89 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dead, my boy," said one of the boat-steerers
gently.</p>

<p>"Dead?" echoed Mendez.</p>

<p>He staggered back. When he had heard the
details of his brother's death, he burst into tears.
All the time his skipper remained aboard, the
poor fellow stood by the cooper's bench and
sobbed.</p>

<p>While drifting at the mouth of Honolulu harbor
one morning, Captain Winchester called for
a boat's crew to row him ashore. All hands
wanted to go. I was one of the lucky ones to
be chosen. The morning was calm and beautiful,
the water was smooth, and we pulled away
with a will.</p>

<p>The city looked inviting at the foot of its
green mountains, its quaint houses embowered in
tropical foliage. On our starboard beam rose
the fine, bold promontory of Diamond Head,
and in between the headland and the city lay
Waikiki, the fashionable bathing beach. We
could see the bathers taking the surf in the
bright morning sunlight, while beyond stretched
a delectable wooded country, above the tops of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[ 90 ]</a></span>
whose trees peeped manors and villas of wealthy
citizens.</p>

<p>We reached the long pier at last and tied up
the boat. While the captain went into the city
the sailors remained on the dock in charge of
Long John, the boat-steerer. Three snaky-eyed
Kanaka policemen in blue uniforms hung about,
watching our every movement. We were not
allowed to stir off the dock. There was a street
corner within a stone's throw. A little red brick
store stood upon it. A lazy Kanaka lounged
against the building, smoking a cigarette. That
corner fascinated me. If I only could dodge
around it! How near it seemed, and yet how
unattainable!</p>

<p>But if we sailormen could not get into town,
we at least had the freedom of the long pier.
This was several hundred feet long and piled
thick with freight of all descriptions, which shut
its harbor end from view. With a casual and
indifferent air I sauntered out along the pier.
In a moment I was hidden behind the merchandise
from the unsuspecting Long John and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[ 91 ]</a></span>
the policemen. I soon reached the harbor end.
I saw that a sharp curve in the shore line brought
the part of the pier on which I was standing close
to land. It seemed easy to dive off the pier, swim
past a big four-masted English ship unloading
alongside, gain the land, and escape to the cane
fields which swept up to the edge of the city.</p>

<p>I sat down behind some freight and began to
take off my shoes. I had one off when a barefooted
Kanaka suddenly stepped into view from
behind a pile of bales and boxes. He was tip-toeing
and peering about him furtively. I knew
him for a spy instantly. Directly he saw me
staring at him he looked as guilty as one taken
in crime, and slunk away sheepishly. I knew he
was on his way to inform on me and made up my
mind not to get my clothes wet by any hopeless
attempt to run away.</p>

<p>I put my shoe back on and strolled back toward
the boat. I saw one of my shipmates&mdash;it
was Richard, the deep-water German sailor&mdash;walking
up the gang-plank of the English ship
alongside the dock. I followed him. When we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[ 92 ]</a></span>
reached the deck, we saw a gang of sailors working
about an open hatch.</p>

<p>"Hello, mates," said Richard. "We are merchant
seamen and want to clear out from a
blooming whaler. Stow us away, won't you?"</p>

<p>The sailors didn't seem to take kindly to the
proposition. Perhaps they were afraid of getting
into trouble. But they told us we might go
down in the fore-peak of the ship and stow ourselves
away. Richard and I climbed down three
decks and found ourselves in the chain lockers
deep in the ship's bow. It was pitch dark down
there and we lay upon the ship's cable in the
farthest corners. For three hours we huddled
there in silence.</p>

<p>Just when we were beginning to congratulate
ourselves that our escape would be successful, the
hatch was pulled off suddenly and three Kanaka
policemen with drawn clubs came leaping down
upon us.</p>

<p>"Come out of this, you," they yelled, swearing
at us and brandishing their billets. The jig was
up; resistance would have got us only broken
heads. We were led upon deck and escorted toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[ 93 ]</a></span>
the gangway for the pier. But I was for
one more try before giving up. Suddenly I
darted for the rail on the harbor side of the ship.
We were in the waist and the bulwarks reached
about to my breast. Before the Kanaka policemen
had recovered from their surprise I had
plunged head first over the rail and dived into
the water twenty or thirty feet below. When I
came to the surface I struck out for shore with
all my might. It was only a short swim. I soon
made the land and dragged myself, dripping
brine, out upon a beach.</p>

<p>I glanced toward the pier. The policemen,
with a crowd at their backs, were dashing for me
along shore. I started for the cane fields, but in
my wet and heavy clothes I stumbled along as
if there was lead in my shoes. Perhaps I ran a
quarter of a mile. My pursuers gained on me
steadily. I was drawing near a cane field, in
which I felt I should be able to lose myself; but
before reaching it, my pursuers sprang upon me
and bore me to the ground. Then, with a policeman
on either side of me, I was marched back to
the brig's boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The populace had turned out royally in my
honor and I passed through a lane of brown
humanity that bent round eyes upon me and
chortled and spluttered Kanaka and seemed to
get a huge amount of enjoyment out of my capture.
As my captors paraded me onto the pier,
who should be there waiting for me but Captain
Shorey, our new skipper, just arrived from San
Francisco by steamer. He stood with feet wide
apart and arms folded on his breast and looked
at me steadily with stern, cold eyes. In my wet
clothes I cut a sorry figure. I felt ashamed of
myself and realized that this introduction to my
new captain was not all it should have been.
Captain Winchester had nothing to say to Richard
and me on the long pull back to the brig.
Once aboard, he drew a pint of Jamaica rum
from his pocket and gave every man of the boat's
crew, except us, a swig. But no penalty of any
sort was imposed upon us for our escapade.
This surprised us.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">GABRIEL'S LITTLE DRAMA</p>


<p>On a bright, sunshiny morning a few days
later, with a light breeze just ruffling the
harbor, the brig with her sails laid back
and her head pointed seaward was drifting with
the ebb tide perhaps a mile and a quarter off
shore between Honolulu and Diamond Head.
Captain Winchester had set out for the city in
a whale boat. Those of the sailors left aboard
were idling forward. Mr. Landers, the mate,
sat by the skylight on the poop, reading a magazine.
Second Mate Gabriel and the cooper were
busy at the cooper's bench in the waist. No one
else was on deck and I resolved to attempt again
to escape. The situation seemed made to order.</p>

<p>In the warm weather of the tropics, I had
often seen old man Landers, when there was
nothing doing on deck, sit and read by the hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[ 96 ]</a></span>
without ever looking up. I hoped that this
morning his magazine would prove of absorbing
interest. Gabriel and the cooper were intent
upon their work. As for the sailors, I told them
I was going to try to swim ashore and if I were
discovered and they had to lower for me, I asked
them to hurry as little as possible so I might
have every chance to get away.</p>

<p>For my adventure I wore a blue flannel shirt,
dungaree trousers, and my blue cap. I tied my
shoes together with a rope yarn, which I slipped
baldric-fashion over my shoulder. In the belt at
my waist I carried a sailor's sheath knife. With
this I had a foolish idea that I might defend myself
against sharks. Without attracting attention,
I slipped over the bow, climbed down by
the bob-stays, and let myself into the sea. I let
myself wash silently astern past the ship's side
and struck out for shore, swimming on my side
without splash or noise, and looking back to
watch developments aboard.</p>

<p>I am convinced to this day that if I had not
been in the water, old Landers would have kept
his nose in that magazine for an hour or so and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[ 97 ]</a></span>
drowsed and nodded over it as I had seen him
do dozens of times before. Either my good
angel, fearful of the sharks, or my evil genius,
malignantly bent upon thwarting me, must have
poked the old fellow in the ribs. At any rate,
he rose from his chair and stepped to the taff-rail
with a pair of binoculars in his hand. He
placed the glasses to his eyes and squinted toward
the pier to see whether or not the captain
had reached shore. I don't know whether he saw
the captain or not, but he saw me.</p>

<p>"Who's that overboard?" he shouted.</p>

<p>I did not answer. Then he recognized me.</p>

<p>"Hey, you," he cried, calling me by name,
"come back here."</p>

<p>I kept on swimming.</p>

<p>"Lay aft here, a boat's crew," Mr. Landers
sang out.</p>

<p>Gabriel and the cooper ran to the quarter-deck
and stared at me. The sailors came lounging aft
along the rail. Mr. Landers and Gabriel threw
the boat's falls from the davit posts. The sailors
strung out across the deck to lower the boat.</p>

<p>"Lower away," shouted Mr. Landers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98 ]</a></span></p>

<p>One end of the boat went down rapidly. The
other end jerked and lurched and seemed to remain
almost stationary. I wondered whether my
shipmates were bungling purposely. Mr. Landers
and Gabriel sprang among them, brushed
them aside and lowered the boat themselves. A
crew climbed down the brig's side into the boat.
Old Gabriel went as boatheader. In a jiffy the
sweeps were shot into place, the boat was shoved
off, and the chase was on.</p>

<p>All this had taken time. As the ship was drifting
one way and I was quartering off in an almost
opposite direction, I must have been nearly
a half mile from the vessel when Gabriel started
to run me down.</p>

<p>I swam on my side with a long, strong stroke
that fast swimmers used to fancy before the Australian
crawl came into racing vogue. I was
swimming as I never in my life swam before&mdash;swimming
for liberty. All my hope and heart,
as well as all my strength, lay in every stroke.
The clear, warm salt water creamed about my
head and sometimes over it. I was making time.
Swimming on my side, I could see everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[ 99 ]</a></span>
that was happening behind me. As the boat
came after me I noticed there was but a slight
ripple of white water about the prow. Plainly
it was not making great speed.</p>

<p>"Pull away, my boys. We ketch dat feller,"
sang out Gabriel.</p>

<p>Wilson at the midship oar "caught a crab"
and tumbled over backwards, his feet kicking in
the air. Wilson was a good oarsman. He was
my friend. A hundred yards more and Walker
at the tub oar did the same. He also was my
friend.</p>

<p>The boys were doing their best to help me&mdash;to
give me a chance. I knew it. Gabriel knew
it, too. The crafty old negro recognized the
crisis. I could not hear what he said or see all
that he did, but the boys told me about it afterwards.
It must have been a pretty bit of acting.</p>

<p>Suddenly Gabriel half rose from his seat and
peered anxiously ahead.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, "dat poor feller, he
drown. Pull, my boys. Oh, good God!"</p>

<p>The sailors at the sweeps had their backs to
me. It was a good long swim and the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[ 100 ]</a></span>
was full of sharks. It was not difficult to make
them believe that I was verging on tragedy.</p>

<p>"Dere he go down!" Gabriel's voice was
broken and sobbing. "He t'row his hands up.
He underneath de water. I cain't see him. Oh,
dat poor feller! No, dere he come up again&mdash;oh,
good Lord! Pull away, my bully boys, pull
away. We save him yet."</p>

<p>Surely the stage lost a star when Gabriel became
a whaler. The old Thespian was good&mdash;he
was great. His acting carried conviction.
The sailors believed I was drowning. They
leaned upon their oars with a will. The sweeps
bent beneath the powerful strokes. The boat
jumped through the water. I noted the increased
speed by the white spray that began to
stand at the bow. Gabriel helped along the
speed by forward lurches of his body, pushing at
the same time upon the stroke oar. All the while
he kept shouting:</p>

<p>"We save him yet, dat poor feller! Pull
away, my boys."</p>

<p>The boat came up rapidly. In a little while
it was almost upon me. I tried to dodge it by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[ 101 ]</a></span>
darting off at right angles. It was no use&mdash;Gabriel
slewed his tiller and the boat came swishing
round upon me. I had played the game out to
the last and I was beaten&mdash;that was all. I caught
the gunwale near the bow and pulled myself into
the boat.</p>

<p>"You make dam good swim, my boy," said old
Gabriel, smiling at me as he brought the boat
around and headed back for the ship.</p>

<p>I had made a good swim. I was fully a mile
from the brig. I was not much over a half mile
from shore. I looked across the sunlit, dancing
blue water to the land. How easy it would have
been to swim it! How easy it would have been
after I had crawled out upon the sands to hide
in the nearby mountains and live on wild fruit
until the ship started for the north and all danger
of capture was past.</p>

<p>No land could have seemed more beautiful.
Groves of banana, orange, and cocoanut trees
held out their fruit to me. Forests swept to the
summits of the mountains. Flowers were in riotous
bloom everywhere. I could almost count the
ribs in the glossy fronds of the palms. I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[ 102 ]</a></span>
hear the soft crash of the combers on the coral
beaches of those enchanted shores. It all looked
like paradise and I had missed it by half a mile.</p>

<p>When I reached the brig, Mr. Landers permitted
me to put on dry clothing and then put
me in irons, as the sea phrase is. This consisted
in fastening my hands together in front of me
with a pair of steel handcuffs of the ordinary
kind used by sheriffs and policemen everywhere.
Then he made me sit on the main hatch until
Captain Winchester came back from Honolulu,
along toward sundown.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that man?" roared
the captain as he swung over the rail and his eyes
lighted on me.</p>

<p>"He jumped overboard and tried to swim
ashore," said Mr. Landers in his nasal Cape Cod
drawl.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you get my rifle and shoot him?"
thundered the captain.</p>

<p>"Well," returned Mr. Landers, "I don't
shoot folks."</p>

<p>After supper the captain stuck his head out
of the cabin gangway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[ 103 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come down here, you," he said. I stepped
into the cabin, now bright with lighted lamps.
The captain glared at me savagely.</p>

<p>"You want to give me a bad name with Captain
Shorey when he takes command, do you?"
he shouted. "You want to make it appear I
have been hard on my men, eh? You think
you're a smart sea lawyer, but I'll teach you the
bitterest lesson you ever learned. We are bound
for the Arctic Ocean. There are no ships up
there but whale ships, and we do as we please. I
have been sailing to the Arctic for thirteen years
as master and mate of whale ships and I know
just how far I can go in dealing with a man
without making myself liable to law. I am going
to make it as rough for you as I know how
to make it. I will put you over the jumps right.
I will punish you to the limit. This ship is going
to be a floating hell for you for the rest of the
voyage. And when we get back to San Francisco
you can prosecute me all you please."</p>

<p>He drew a key from his pocket and unlocked
one manacle. It dropped from one wrist and
dangled from the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[ 104 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boy," he said to the Kanaka cabin boy, who
has been listening with open mouth and bulging
eyes to this tirade, "get this man a cup of water
and a biscuit."</p>

<p>I had had nothing to eat since breakfast, and
I sat down at the cabin table and ate my one
hardtack and drank my quart tin of water with
a relish. After my meal, the captain fastened
my handcuff again and jerked a little hatch out
of the floor.</p>

<p>"Get down there," he said.</p>

<p>I climbed down and he clapped the hatch on
again. I was in darkness except for the light
that filtered from the cabin lamps through the
four cracks of the hatch. When my eyes had
become accustomed to the dimness, I made out
that I was in the ship's run, where the provisions
for the captain's table were stored. I rummaged
about as well as I could in my handcuffs and
found a sack of raisins open and a box of soda
crackers. To these I helped myself generously.
From a forecastle viewpoint they were rare
dainties, and I filled my empty stomach with
them. I had not tasted anything so good since
I had my last piece of pie ashore. Pie! Dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[ 105 ]</a></span>
me! One doesn't know how good it is&mdash;just
common pie baked in a bakery and sold at the
corner grocery&mdash;until one cannot get it and has
had nothing but salt horse and cracker hash for
months. I used to yearn for pie by day and
dream of pie by night. At bedtime the captain
snatched the hatch off again and tossed me down
my blankets. I bundled up in them as best I
could and slept with my manacles on.</p>

<p>I was kept in irons on bread and water for
five days and nights. Sometimes in the daytime,
with one handcuff unlocked and hanging
from my other wrist, I was put at slushing down
the main boom or washing paint-work. But for
the most part I was held a close prisoner in the
run, being called to the cabin table three times
a day for my bread and water. Finally, when
Captain Shorey came aboard and assumed command
and the vessel headed for the north, I was
released and sent to the forecastle. My shipmates
proved Job's comforters and were filled
with gloomy predictions regarding my future.</p>

<p>"I pity you from now on," each one said.</p>

<p>But their prophecies proved false. After Captain
Shorey took charge of the ship Mr. Winchester
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[ 106 ]</a></span>
became mate. As mate he was, as may
be said, the ship's foreman, directing the work
of the men, and was in much more intimate contact
with the sailors than when he had been skipper.
In his new capacity he had much greater
opportunity to make it unpleasant for me in a
thousand ways. But for some reason or other
he never made good that ferocious speech he had
delivered to me in the cabin.</p>

<p>When other green hands bungled, he damned
them in round terms for their awkwardness.
When I blundered he showed me how to correct
my error. "Not that way, my boy," he would
say. "Do it this way." When I took my trick
at the wheel he would often spin a yarn or crack
a joke with me. He loaned me books from time
to time. In Behring Sea, when he got out his
rifle and shot okchug seals as they lay basking
on cakes of ice, he almost invariably took me
with him in the boat to bring back the kill. In
short, he treated me more considerately than he
treated any other man in the forecastle and before
the voyage was over we had become fast
friends.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THROUGH THE ROARING FORTIES</p>


<p>Before leaving the islands, we shipped a
Portuguese negro boat-steerer to take the
place of the Night King. He was coal
black, had a wild roll to his eyes, an explosive,
spluttering way of talking, looked strikingly like
a great ape, and had little more than simian intelligence.
His feet had the reputation of being
the largest feet in the Hawaiian Islands. When
I had seen them I was prepared to believe they
were the largest in the world. He was dubbed
"Big Foot" Louis, and the nickname stuck to
him during the voyage. He came aboard barefooted.
I don't know whether he could find any
shoes in the islands big enough to fit him or not.
Anyway, he didn't need shoes in the tropics.</p>

<p>When we began to get north into cold weather
he needed them badly, and there were none on
board large enough for him to get his toes in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[ 108 ]</a></span>
The captain went through his stock of Eskimo
boots, made of walrus hide and very elastic, but
they were too small. When we entered the region
of snow, Louis was still running about the
deck barefooted. As a last resort he sewed himself
a pair of canvas shoes&mdash;regular meal sacks&mdash;and
wore them through snow and blizzard and
during the cold season when we were in the grip
of the Behring Sea ice pack. Up around Behring
straits the captain hired an Eskimo to make
a pair of walrus hide boots big enough for Louis
to wear, and Louis wore them until we got back
to San Francisco and went ashore in them. I
met him wandering along Pacific Street in his
walrus hides. However, he soon found a pair of
brogans which he could wear with more or less
comfort.</p>

<p>One night while I was knocking about the
Barbary Coast with my shipmates we heard
dance music and the sound of revelry coming
from behind the swinging doors of the Bow Bells
saloon, a free-and-easy resort. We stepped inside.
Waltzing around the room with the grace
of a young bowhead out of water was "Big-Foot"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[ 109 ]</a></span>
Louis, his arm around the waist of a
buxom negress, and on his feet nothing but a
pair of red socks. We wondered what had become
of his shoes and spied them on the piano,
which the "professor" was vigorously strumming.
Louis seemed to be having more fun than
anybody, and was perfectly oblivious to the titters
of the crowd and to the fact that it was not
<i>de rigueur</i> on the Barbary Coast to dance in
one's socks.</p>

<p>We left the Hawaiian Islands late in March
and, standing straight north, soon left the tropics
behind, never to see them again on the voyage.
As we plunged into the "roaring forties" we
struck our first violent storm. The fury of the
gale compelled us to heave to under staysails and
drift, lying in the troughs of the seas and riding
the waves sidewise. The storm was to me a revelation
of what an ocean gale could be. Old sailors
declared they never had seen anything worse.
The wind shrieked and whistled in the rigging
like a banshee. It was impossible to hear ordinary
talk and the men had to yell into each
other's ears. We put out oil bags along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[ 110 ]</a></span>
weather side to keep the waves from breaking.
But despite the oil that spread from them over
the water, giant seas frequently broke over the
brig. One crushed the waist boat into kindling
wood and sent its fragments flying all over the
deck. We were fortunate to have several other
extra boats in the hold against just such an emergency.
Waves sometimes filled the ship to the
top of the bulwarks and the sailors waded about
up to their breasts in brine until the roll of the
vessel spilled the water overboard or it ran back
into the sea through the scuppers and hawse-holes.</p>

<p>The waves ran as high as the topsail yard.
They would pile up to windward of us, gaining
height and volume until we had to look up almost
vertically to see the tops. Just as a giant
comber seemed ready to break in roaring foam
and curl over and engulf us, the staunch little
brig would slip up the slope of water and ride
over the summit in safety. Then the sea would
shoot out on the other side of the vessel with a
deafening hiss like that of a thousand serpents
and rush skyward again, the wall of water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[ 111 ]</a></span>
streaked and shot with foam and looking like a
polished mass of jade or agate.</p>

<p>I had not imagined water could assume such
wild and appalling shapes. Those monster
waves seemed replete with malignant life, roaring
out their hatred of us and watching alertly
with their devilish foam-eyes for a chance to leap
upon us and crush us or sweep us to death on
their crests.</p>

<p>I became genuinely seasick now for the first
time. A little touch of seasickness I had experienced
in the tropics was as nothing. To the rail
I went time and again to give up everything
within me, except my immortal soul, to the mad
gods of sea. For two days I lay in my bunk. I
tried pickles, fat bacon, everything that any
sailor recommended, all to no purpose. I would
have given all I possessed for one fleeting moment
upon something level and still, something
that did not plunge and lurch and roll from side
to side and rise and fall. I think the most
wretched part of seasickness is the knowledge
that you cannot run away from it, that you are
penned in with it, that go where you will, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[ 112 ]</a></span>
royal yard or in the bilge, you cannot escape the
ghastly nightmare even for a minute.</p>

<p>There is no use fighting it and no use dosing
yourself with medicines or pickles or lemons or
fat meat. Nothing can cure it. In spite of
everything it will stay with you until it has
worked its will to the uttermost, and then it will
go away at last of its own accord, leaving you a
wan, limp wreck. I may add, to correct a general
impression, that it is impossible to become
seasoned to seasickness. One attack does not
render the victim immune from future recurrences.
I was very sick once again on the voyage.
After a season ashore, the best sailors are
liable to seasickness, especially if they encounter
rough weather soon after leaving port. Some
time later we were frozen solidly in Behring Sea
for three weeks. When a storm swell from the
south broke up the ice and the motionless brig
began suddenly to rock and toss on a heavy sea,
every mother's son aboard, including men who
had been to sea all their lives, was sick. Not
one escaped.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[ 113 ]</a></span></p>

<p>During the storm we kept a man at the wheel
and another on the try-works as a lookout. One
day during my trick at the wheel, I was probably
responsible for a serious accident, though it
might have happened with the most experienced
sailor at the helm. To keep the brig in the trough
of the seas, I was holding her on a certain point
of the compass, but the big waves buffeted the
vessel about with such violence that my task was
difficult. Captain Shorey was standing within
arm's length of me, watching the compass. A
sea shoved the brig's head to starboard and, as if
it had been lying in ambush for just such an
opportunity, a giant comber came curling in
high over the stern. It smashed me into the
wheel and for an instant I was buried under
twenty feet of crystal water that made a green
twilight all about us.</p>

<p>Then the wave crashed down ponderously
upon the deck and I was standing in clear air
again. To my astonishment, the captain was
no longer beside me. I thought he had been
washed overboard. The wave had lifted him
upon its top, swept him high over the skylight
the entire length of the quarter-deck and dropped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[ 114 ]</a></span>
him on the main deck in the waist. His right
leg was broken below the knee. Sailors and
boat-steerers rushed to him and carried him into
the cabin, where Mr. Winchester set the broken
bones. We put into Unalaska a week later and
the surgeon of the revenue cutter <i>Bear</i> reset the
leg. This was in the last days of March. The
captain was on crutches in July, when we caught
our first whale.</p>

<p>The storm did not blow itself out. It blew us
out of it. We must have drifted sidewise with
the seas about six hundred miles. At dawn of
the second day, after leaving the fury of the
forties behind, we were bowling along in smooth
water with all sails set. The sky was clear
and the sea like hammered silver. Far ahead a
mountain rose into the sky&mdash;a wedge-shaped
peak, silver-white with snow, its foot swathed in
purple haze. It rose above Unimak Pass, which
connects the Pacific Ocean and Behring Sea between
Unimak and Ugamok islands of the Fox
Island chain.</p>

<p>Unimak Pass is ten miles broad, and its towering
shores are sheer, black, naked rock. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[ 115 ]</a></span>
Winchester, who had assumed command after
the captain had broken his leg, set a course to
take us directly through the passage. Running
before a light breeze that bellied all our sails, we
began to draw near the sea gorge at the base of
the mountain. Then, without warning, from
over the horizon came a savage white squall,
blotting out mountain, pass, sea, and sky.</p>

<p>I never saw bad weather blow up so quickly.
One moment the ship was gliding over a smooth
sea in bright sunlight. The next, a cloud as
white and almost as thick as wool had closed
down upon it; snow was falling heavily in big,
moist flakes, a stiff wind was heeling the vessel
on its side, and we could not see ten feet beyond
the tip of the jib boom.</p>

<p>The wind quickened into a gale. By fast
work we managed to furl sails and double-reef
the topsail before they carried away. Soon the
deck was white with four or five inches of snow.
On the forecastle-head Big Foot Louis was
posted as lookout. Everybody was anxious.
Mr. Winchester took his stand close by the main
shrouds at the break of the poop and kept gazing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[ 116 ]</a></span>
ahead through his glasses into the mist. The
sailors and boat-steerers crowded the forward
rails, peering vainly into the swirling fog. Big
Foot Louis bent forward with his hand shielding
his eyes from the falling snow.</p>

<p>"Land, land!" he cried.</p>

<p>If it were land that Louis saw through the
clouds and blinding snow, it was mighty close.
Our doom seemed sealed. We expected the ship
to crash bows-on upon the rocks. We nerved
ourselves for the shock. A momentary vision of
shipwreck on those bleak coasts in snow and
storm obsessed me. But Louis's eyes had deceived
him. The ship went riding on its stately
way through the blinding snow before the gale.</p>

<p>The situation was ticklish, if not critical. We
had been headed squarely for the passage before
the storm closed down. Now we could not see
where we were going. If we held directly upon
our course we were safe. If the gale blew us
even slightly out of our way, shipwreck and
death on the rock-bound shore awaited us.
Which would it be?</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester was a man of iron nerve. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[ 117 ]</a></span>
demonstrated this now as he did many times
afterward. He was as skillful a navigator as
he was a fearless one. He knew his reckonings
were good. He knew that when the squall shut
out the world the brig's nose was pointed directly
at the center of Unimak Pass. So he did not
veer to east or west, or seek to tack back from
the dangerous coasts on our bows, but drove the
vessel straight upon its course into the blank
white wall of mist and snow.</p>

<p>An hour later the squall lifted as quickly as
it had come. Blue skies and sunshine came back.
We found ourselves almost becalmed on a placid
sea. To the south lay the outline of a lofty
coast.</p>

<p>A boat-steerer bustled forward. "We are in
Behring Sea," he said with a laugh.</p>

<p>We had shot through the narrow channel
without sighting the shores. I have often wondered
just how close to port or starboard death
was to us that morning on the black cliffs of
Unimak Pass.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">IN THE ICE</p>


<p>From Unalaska, into which port we put
to have the captain's leg attended to, the
brig stood northwesterly for the spring
whaling on the bowhead and right whale
grounds off the Siberian coast. We were a
week's sail from the Fox Islands when we encountered
our first ice. It appeared in small
chunks floating down from the north. The
blocks became more numerous until they dappled
the sea. They grew in size. Strings and
floes appeared. Then we brought up against a
great ice field stretching to the north as far as
the eye could see. It was all floe ice broken
into hummocks and pressure ridges and pinnacles,
with level spaces between. There were no
towering 'bergs such as are launched into the sea
from the glaciers on the Greenland coast and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[ 119 ]</a></span>
the Pacific coast of Alaska. The highest 'berg
I saw on the voyage was not more than forty
feet high. It was composed of floe ice which had
been forced upward by the pressure of the pack.</p>

<p>The crow's nest was now rigged and placed in
position on the cross-trees abaft the fore-mast,
between the topsail and the fore-top-gallant-sail
yard. It was a square box of heavy white canvas
nailed upon a wooden frame-work. When a
man stood in it the canvas sides reached to his
breast and were a protection against the bitter
winds. From early morning until dark an officer
and a boat-steerer occupied the crow's nest
and kept a constant lookout for whales.</p>

<p>As soon as we struck the ice the captain's slop-chest
was broken open and skin clothes were
dealt out to the men. Accoutred for cold
weather, I wore woolen underwear and yarn
socks next my flesh; an outer shirt of squirrel
skin with hood or parka; pants and vest of hair
seal of the color and sheen of newly minted silver;
a coat of dogskin that reached almost to my
knees; a dogskin cap; deer-skin socks with the
hair inside over my yarn socks; walrus-hide boots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[ 120 ]</a></span>
and walrus-hide mittens over yarn mittens. The
walrus-boots were fastened by a gathering string
just below the knees and by thongs of tanned skin
about the ankle. Some of the men wore heavy
reindeer-skin coats. The skin clothes worn by the
officers and boat-steerers were of finer quality
and more pretentious. Perhaps the handsomest
costume was that of Little Johnny. It consisted
of coat, vest, and trousers of silvery hair-seal,
with the edges of the coat trimmed with the
snowwhite fur of fur-seal pups. With this he
wore a black dogskin cap and walrus-hide boots.</p>

<p>While we were among the ice, the officer in the
crow's nest directed the course of the brig.
Whaling officers are great fellows to show their
skill by just grazing dangerous ice. Many a
time we green hands stood with our hearts in our
mouths as the ship seemed about to crash into a
'berg bows-on.</p>

<p>"Starboard, sir," the helmsman would respond.</p>

<p>"Starboard," would come the order from
aloft.</p>

<p><a id="fp120"></a><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 598px;">
<img src="images/page120.png" width="598" height="378" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Waiting For the Floes to Open</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[ 121 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The bow would swing slowly to one side and
the 'berg would go glancing along the rail so
close perhaps that we could have grabbed a
snowball off some projection.</p>

<p>"Steady," the officer would call.</p>

<p>"Steady, sir." The bow would stop in its
lateral swing.</p>

<p>"Port."</p>

<p>"Port, sir." The bow would swing the other
way.</p>

<p>"Steady." We would be upon our old course
again.</p>

<p>Once I remember the mate was in the crow's
nest and had been narrowly missing ice all day
for the fun of the thing&mdash;"showing off," as we
rather disturbed green hands said. A 'berg
about thirty feet high, a giant for Behring Sea
waters, showed a little ahead and to leeward of
our course. The mate thought he could pass to
windward. He kept the brig close to the wind
until the 'berg was very near. Then he saw a
windward passage was impossible and tried suddenly
to go to leeward.</p>

<p>"Hard up your wheel," he cried.</p>

<p>"Hard up it is, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[ 122 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The bow swung toward the 'berg&mdash;swung
slowly, slowly across it. The tip of the jib-boom
almost rammed a white pinnacle. Just when
everybody was expecting the brig to pile up in
wreck on the ice, the great 'berg swept past our
starboard rail. But we had not missed it. Its
jagged edges scraped a line an inch deep along
our side from bow to stern.</p>

<p>Shooting <i>okchug</i> (or, as it is sometimes spelled,
ooksook) or hair seals was a favorite amusement
in the spring ice. The mate was an expert with
a rifle. He shot many as they lay sunning themselves
on ice cakes. Okchugs are as large as oxen
and are covered with short silvery hair so glossy
that it fairly sparkles. If an okchug was killed
outright, its head dropped over upon the ice and
it lay still. If only slightly wounded, the animal
flounced off into the sea. If vitally hurt, it remained
motionless with its head up and glaring
defiance, whereupon a boat's crew would row out
to the ice cake and a sailor would finish the creature
with a club.</p>

<p>It was exciting to step on a small ice cake to
face a wounded and savage okchug. The animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[ 123 ]</a></span>
would come bouncing on its flippers straight
at one with a vicious barking roar. The nose
was the okchug's most vulnerable point. A tap
on the nose with a club would stretch the great
creature out dead. It required a cool head, a
steady nerve, and a good aim to deliver this finishing
stroke upon the small black snout. If one
missed or slipped on the ice, the possible consequences
would not have been pleasant. We
tanned the skins of the okchugs and made them
into trousers or "pokes." The meat was hung
over the bows to keep in an ice-box of all outdoors.
Ground up and made into sausages, it
was a <i>pi&egrave;ce de resistance</i> on the forecastle bill of
fare.</p>

<p>One night in the latter part of May we saw
far off a great light flaring smokily across the
sea. It was what is known in whaler parlance as
a bug-light and was made by blazing blubber
swinging in an iron basket between the two
smokestacks of a whale-ship's try-works. By it
the crew of that distant ship was working at
trying out a whale. The bug-light signaled to
all the whaling fleet the first whale of the season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[ 124 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The great continent of ice drifting southward
gradually closed round the fleet. The ships had
worked so far in there was no escape. In the
early part of June the brig was frozen in. For
three weeks the vessel remained motionless in
solid ice with every stitch of canvas furled. No
water or land was in sight&mdash;nothing but one
great sweep of broken and tumbled ice as far as
the eye could see. Those three ice-bound June
weeks were given over to idleness. A stove was
placed in the forecastle and was kept going night
and day. This made it possible to keep comfortable
and to read.</p>

<p>We went on frequent seal hunts. We strolled
across the frozen sea to visit the other ships, the
nearest of which was two miles away. Visiting
is called "gamming" by whalers. We learned
the gossip of the fleet, who had taken the first
whale, how many whales had been caught, the
adventures of the ships, the comedies and tragedies
of the whaling season.</p>

<p>We established, too, what we called the "Behring
Sea Circulating Library." There were a
number of books in every forecastle. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[ 125 ]</a></span>
greasy, dog-eared volumes were passed about
from ship to ship. Perhaps there were twenty
books aboard the brig which had been read by
almost every member of the crew, forward and
aft. Before we got out of the ice, we had exchanged
these volumes for an entirely new lot
from other ships.</p>

<p>One morning I awoke with the ship rocking
like a cradle. I pulled on my clothes and hurried
on deck. The ice fields were in wild commotion.
Great swells from some storm upon the
open sea to the south were rolling under them.
Crowded and tumultuous waves of ice twenty
feet high chased each other across the frozen
fields from horizon to horizon. The ship would
sink for a moment between ridges of ice and
snow, and then swing up on the crest of an ice
mountain. Great areas of ice would fall away
as if the sea had opened beneath them. Then
they would shoot up and shut out half the sky.
The broken and jagged edges of these white and
solid billows appeared for an instant like a range
of snowy sierras which, in another instant, would
crumble from view as if some seismic cataclysm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[ 126 ]</a></span>
had shaken them down in ruin. The air was
filled with grinding, crushing, ominous noises
and explosions.</p>

<p>The ship was in imminent peril. In that mad
turmoil of ice it seemed certain she would be
ground to pieces. Captain Shorey, who was
hobbling about on crutches, ordered a cask of
bread, a cask of water, and a barrel of beef
hoisted on deck ready to be thrown out on an
ice cake in case the brig were wrecked and we
were cast away.</p>

<p>In the grinding of the floes, the ship became
wedged in between two immense pieces of ice.
The great bergs washed closer and closer.
When they rose on some tremendous billow,
great caverns, washed out by the sea, appeared
in their sides like mouths, edged with splinters
and points of blue and glittering ice, like fangs.
As they rose and fell, it seemed the two white
monsters were opening and closing devouring
maws for us while the suck of the water in their
ice caves made noises like the roar of hungry
beasts of prey.</p>

<p>A cable was run out hurriedly over the bow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[ 127 ]</a></span>
and a bowline at the end of it was slipped over
a hummock of ice. With the inboard end
wound around the windlass, all hands worked
like beavers to heave the brig out of her dangerous
position. It was all the crew could do
to swing the windlass bars up and down. The
ship went forward slowly, almost imperceptibly,
and all the time the great bergs swept closer
and closer. For a long time it looked as if we
were doomed. There was no doubt about the
ship's fate if the bergs struck it. But inch by
inch, heave by heave, we hauled her through.
Ten minutes later, the ice monsters came together
with a force that would have crushed an
ironclad.</p>

<p>Gradually patches of clear water began to
appear in the ice. It was as though the white
fields were opening great blue eyes. Little
lakes and zigzag lanes of water formed. Sails
were set. The brig began to work her way
along. Soon she was swinging on heavy billows&mdash;not
white billows of ice but green billows
of water, thick with ice in stars and constellations.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">CROSS COUNTRY WHALING</p>


<p>We had hardly washed clear of the ice in
the heavy seas when "Blow!" rang
from the crow's nest. A school of
whales close ahead, covering the sea with fountains,
was coming leisurely toward the ship.
There were more than thirty of them.</p>

<p>"Bowheads!" shouted the mate.</p>

<p>Their great black heads rose above the surface
like ponderous pieces of machinery; tall
fountains shot into the air; the wind caught the
tops of the fountains and whisked them off in
smoke; hollow, sepulchral whispers of sound
came to the brig as the breath left the giant
lungs in mighty exhalations. Why they were
called bowheads was instantly apparent&mdash;the
outline of the top of the head curved like an
Indian's bow. As the head sank beneath the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[ 129 ]</a></span>
surface, the glistening back, half as broad as a
city street and as black as asphalt, came spinning
up out of the sea and went spinning down
again.</p>

<p>Our crippled captain in his fur clothes and
on crutches limped excitedly about the quarter-deck
glaring at $300,000 worth of whales spouting
under his nose. But with so much ice about
and such a heavy sea running he was afraid to
lower.</p>

<p>If the whales saw the brig they gave no sign.
They passed all around the vessel, the spray of
their fountains blowing on deck. One headed
straight for the ship. The mate seized a shoulder
bomb-gun and ran to the bow. The whale rose,
blew a fountain up against the jib-boom, and
dived directly beneath the brig's forefoot. As
its back curled down, the mate, with one knee
resting on the starboard knighthead, took aim
and fired. He surely hit the whale&mdash;there was
little chance to miss. But the bomb evidently
did not strike a vital spot, for the leviathan
passed under the ship, came up on the other
side and went on about its business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[ 130 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The sight of all these whales passing by us
with such unconcern, blowing water on us as if
in huge contempt, almost seeming to laugh at
us and mock our bombs and harpoons and human
skill, drove the captain frantic. Should he
allow that fortune in whales to escape him without
a try for it? With purple face and popping
eyes he gazed at the herd now passing astern.</p>

<p>"Lower them boats!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What?" expostulated Mr. Landers. "Do
you want to get us all killed?"</p>

<p>"Lower them boats!" yelled the skipper.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that a boat that gets fast to
a whale in that ice will be smashed, sure?"</p>

<p>"Lower them boats!" shouted the captain.</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester, enthusiastic and fearless
whaleman that he was, was eager for the captain's
order. His boat and Mr. Landers's went
down. The waist boat&mdash;mine&mdash;was left on its
davits. But Gabriel, its boatheader, armed with
a shoulder gun, went in the mate's boat. Left
aboard to help work ship, I had an opportunity
to view that exciting chase from beginning to
end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[ 131 ]</a></span></p>

<p>With storm-reefed sails, the boats went plunging
away over the big seas, dodging sharply
about to avoid the ice cakes. Not more than
two hundred yards away on our starboard beam
a great whale was blowing. The mate marked
it and went for it like a bull dog. He steered to
intercept its course. It was a pretty piece of
maneuvering. The whale rose almost in front
of him and his boat went shooting upon its back.
Long John let fly his harpoon. Gabriel fired a
bomb from his shoulder gun. There was a flurry
of water as the whale plunged under. Back and
forth it slapped with its mighty flukes as it disappeared,
narrowly missing the boat. Down
came the boat's sail. It was bundled up in a
jiffy and the mast slewed aft until it stuck out
far behind. Out went the sweeps. The mate
stood in the stern wielding a long steering oar.
I could see the whale line whipping and sizzling
out over the bows.</p>

<p>For only a moment the whale remained beneath
the surface. Then it breached. Its black
head came shooting up from the water like a
titanic rocket. Up went the great body into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[ 132 ]</a></span>
air until at least forty feet of it was lifted
against the sky like some weird, mighty column,
its black sides glistening and its belly showing
white. Then the giant bulk crashed down again
with a smack on the sea that might have been
heard for miles and an impact that sent tons of
water splashing high in air. For an instant the
monster labored on the water as if mortally hurt,
spouting up fountains of clotted blood that
splattered over the ice blocks and turned them
from snow white to crimson. Then a second
time the whale sounded and went speeding away
to windward, heading for the ice pack.</p>

<p>It dragged the boat at a dizzy clip despite the
fact that the line was running out so fast as to
seem to the men in the boat a mere vibrant, indistinct
smear of yellow. The boat was taken
slicing through the big waves, driving its nose
at times beneath the water, and knocking against
lumps of ice. A long ice block appeared in its
course. A collision seemed inevitable unless the
boat was cut loose from the whale.</p>

<p>Captain Shorey was watching the chase with
fierce intentness as he leaned upon his crutches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[ 133 ]</a></span>
on the forecastle head. He had been filled with
great joy, seized with anxiety or shaken with
anger as the hunt passed from one phase to another.
He shouted his emotions aloud though
there was never a chance for the men in the boats
to hear him.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Long John," he had cried when
the boatsteerer drove his harpoon home.</p>

<p>"That's our fish," he had chortled as the
wounded leviathan leaped high against the sky
and spouted blood over the ice.</p>

<p>Now when it seemed possible that the mate
would be forced to cut loose from the whale to
save his boat from destruction, the captain
danced about on his crutches in wild excitement.</p>

<p>"Don't cut that line! Don't cut that line!"
he yelled.</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester realized as well as the captain
that there was something like $10,000 on
the other end of the rope, and he had no idea of
cutting loose. Towed by the whale the boat
drove toward the ice. The mate worked hard
with his steering oar to avoid striking the block.
It was impossible. The bow smashed into one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[ 134 ]</a></span>
end of the ice cake, was lifted out of the water
and dragged across to slip back into the sea. A
hole was stove in the starboard bow through
which the water rushed. The crew thereafter
was kept busy bailing.</p>

<p>It was evident from the fountains of blood
that the whale was desperately wounded, but its
vitality was marvelous and it seemed it might
escape. When Mr. Landers saw the mate's line
being played out so rapidly he should have hurried
to the mate's boat and bent the line from his
own tub to the end of the mate's line. As an
old whaleman Mr. Landers knew what to do in
this crisis, but in such ice and in such high seas
he preferred not to take a chance. He was a
cautious soul, so he held his boat aloof. The
mate waved to him frantically. Long John and
Gabriel wigwagged frenzied messages with waving
arms.</p>

<p>As for Captain Shorey on his crutches on the
forecastle head, when it seemed certain that the
whale would run away with all the mate's line
and escape, he apparently suffered temporary
aberration. He damned old man Landers in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[ 135 ]</a></span>
every picturesque and fervent term of an old
whaleman's vocabulary. He shook his fist at
him. He waved a crutch wildly.</p>

<p>"Catch that whale!" he yelled in a voice
husky and broken with emotion. "For God's
sake, catch that whale!"</p>

<p>All this dynamic pantomime perhaps had its
effect on Landers. At any rate, his men began
to bend to their sweeps and soon his boat was
alongside that of the mate. His line was tied to
the free end of the rope in the mate's almost exhausted
tub just in time. The mate's line ran
out and Landers' boat now became fast to the
whale.</p>

<p>Fortune favored Landers. His boat was
dragged over the crests of the seas at thrilling
speed, but he managed to keep clear of ice. The
whale showed no sign of slowing down. In a
little while it had carried away all the line in
Mr. Landers' tub. The monster was free of the
boats at last. It had ceased to come to the surface
to blow. It had gone down into the deep
waters carrying with it the mate's harpoon and
800 fathoms of manila rope. It seemed probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[ 136 ]</a></span>
it had reached the safety of the ice pack and
was lost.</p>

<p>The boats came back to the brig; slowly,
wounded, limping over the waves. The flying
spray had frozen white over the fur clothes of
the men, making them look like snow images.
They climbed aboard in silence. Mr. Landers
had a hang-dog, guilty look. The skipper was
a picture of gloom and smoldering fury. He
bent a black regard upon Mr. Landers as the
latter swung over the rail, but surprised us all
by saying not a word.</p>

<p>When the next day dawned, we were out of
sight of ice, cruising in a quiet sea. A lookout
posted on the forecastle head saw far ahead a
cloud of gulls flapping about a dark object
floating on the surface. It was the dead whale.</p>

<p class="caption3">CUTTING IN AND TRYING OUT</p>


<p>Two boats were sent to secure the whale.
I lowered with one. As we came up to
the whale, I marveled at its immense bulk.
It looked even larger than when it had breached
and I had seen it shoot up, a giant column of
flesh and blood, against the heavens. It had
turned belly up as dead whales do, its ridged
white abdomen projecting above the waves. It
seemed much like a mighty white and black rock,
against which the waves lapped lazily. Seventy-five
feet long the officers estimated it&mdash;an unusually
large bull whale. I had never imagined
any animal so large. I had seen Jumbo, said to
be the largest elephant ever in captivity. Jumbo
made ordinary circus elephants seem like pigmies.
This whale was as big as a dozen Jumbos.
The great hairy mammoth, of which I had seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[ 138 ]</a></span>
stuffed specimens in museums, would have
seemed a mere baby beside this monster of the
deep.</p>

<p>As proof that the whale was ours, the harpoon
sticking in its back bore the brig's name,
and fast to the haft and floating far out on the
sea in a tangled mass was the 800 fathoms of
line from the brig's two tubs. Our first work
was to recover the line. As this had to be
straightened out and coiled in the boats, it was
a long and tedious job. Then with a short sharp
spade, a hole was cut through the whale's flukes
and a cable passed through and made fast.
With both boats strung out along the cable, the
men bent to the sweeps, hauling the carcass
slowly toward the brig. Meanwhile the vessel
had been sailing toward us. So we had but a
hundred yards or so to pull.</p>

<p>The loose end of the hawser was passed
through the hawse-hole in the starboard bow and
made fast to the fore-bitt. In this way the flukes
were held close to the bow. As the brig made
headway under short sail, the great body washed
back against the vessel's side and lay upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[ 139 ]</a></span>
surface, the head abreast the wheel on the quarter-deck&mdash;which
will give an idea of the whale's
length.</p>

<p>The gang-plank was taken from the bulwarks
and a cutting stage lowered over the whale.
This stage was made of three broad planks.
Two projected from the ship's side, the third
joined their outer ends. Along the inside of
the third plank was a low railing. Two officers
took their station on the outer plank with long-handled
spades to cut in the blubber. The spade
was enough like a garden spade in shape to suggest
its name and was fastened to a long pole.
Its cutting edge was as sharp as a razor.</p>

<p>A block and tackle was rigged above the
whale, the upper block fastened to the cross-trees
of the main mast and the tackle carried
forward to the windlass. A great hook was fastened
into the whale's blubber, and everything
was ready for the cutting in.</p>

<p>As the officers with their spades cut under the
blubber, the sailors heaved on the windlass. The
blanket piece of blubber began to rise. As it
rose, the officers kept spading under it, rolling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[ 140 ]</a></span>
the whale over gradually. Thus the whale was
peeled much as one would peel a roll of bologna
sausage. When the great carcass had been
rolled completely over, the blanket piece of
blubber came off. The upper end of it fast to
the tackle hook was up almost against the cross-trees
as the lower end swung free. The largest
blanket pieces weighed perhaps ten tons. Six
were taken off in the process of skinning. The
weight of the whale, I should estimate, was
roughly something like one hundred tons, perhaps
a little more.</p>

<p>When the blanket piece was cut free from the
whale it swung inboard, and as it came over the
main hatch, it was lowered into the hold. There
men fell upon it with short spades, cutting it
into small pieces and distributing them equally
about the ship to prevent the vessel from listing.
It took most of the day to strip the whale of its
blubber. When this had been finished the great
flensed carcass stretched out along the ship's
side a mass of blood-red flesh. The final work
was cutting in the "old head."</p>

<p>Long John with an axe climbed down upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[ 141 ]</a></span>
the whale's back. As it was his boat that had
struck the whale the cutting in of the head was
his job. Nobody envied him the task. The
stripped body of a whale offers a surface as slippery
as ice. As the waves rocked the whale,
Long John had much ado to keep his footing.
Once he fell and almost tumbled into the water.
Finally he cut himself two foot-holds and began
to wield his axe, raining blows upon the neck.
He chopped through from the upper neck surface
into the corners of the mouth, thus loosening
the head and upper jaw from the body. The
lower jaw is devoid of teeth. The tackle hook
having been fixed in the tip-top of the head's
bowlike curve, the windlass men heaved away.
Up rose the head above the bulwarks and swung
inwards.</p>

<p>"Lower, lower away!" cried the mate.</p>

<p>Down came the head upon the deck and a
great cheer went up. The "old head" was safe.
Immediately afterwards, the mate came forward
with a bottle of Jamaica rum and gave each
man a swig. "Bringing in his old head," as it
is called, is a memorable event in cutting in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[ 142 ]</a></span>
whale, and is always celebrated by dealing out
a drink all around.</p>

<p>Great hunks of meat were cut out from the
carcass. These were hung over the bow. The
meat was served in the form of steaks and sausages
in both forecastle and cabin. And let me
give my testimony right here that whale steak
is mighty good eating. It tastes something like
tender beef, though it is coarser grained and of
ranker flavor. We preferred to eat it as steaks,
though made into meat balls with gravy it was
extremely toothsome. I do not know how whale
would taste if served on the home table, but at
sea, after months of salt horse and "sow belly,"
it was delicious. The hunks became coated with
ice over the bow and kept well. They lasted us
for several weeks.</p>

<p>When the carcass was cut adrift it went floating
astern. Flocks of gulls and sea birds that
had been constantly hovering about the ship in
hundreds waiting for the feast swooped down
upon it. The body washed slowly out of sight,
still swarmed over by the gulls.</p>

<p>The head rested in the waist near the poop.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[ 143 ]</a></span>
It was, I should say, twelve feet high at the crest
of the bow, and suggested some strange sort of
tent. I stepped inside it without bending my
head and walked about in it. Its sides were
shaggy with the long hair hanging from the
teeth or baleen, and the interior resembled, in a
way, a hunter's forest lodge made of pine
boughs. If the head had been in a forest instead
of on the deck of a ship it would have formed an
ideal shelter for a winter's night with a wood fire
burning at the opening.</p>

<p>Only the lower tip of the head or what we
might call the nose rested on the deck. It was
supported otherwise upon the teeth. I now had
my first opportunity to see baleen in its natural
setting. The teeth viewed from the outside
looked something like the interior of a piano.
The whale's gums, following the bony skeleton
of the jaw, formed an arched and undulant line
from nose tip to the back of the jaw. The front
teeth were six inches long; the back ones were
ten feet. Each tooth, big and little alike, was
formed of a thin slab of bluish whalebone, almost
flat. The largest of these slabs were six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[ 144 ]</a></span>
inches broad at their base in the gum. The
smallest were an inch. All tapered to a point.
They were set in the gum with the flat surfaces
together and almost touching. They were extremely
pliant and at the outer ends could be
pulled wide apart. The inner edges were hung
with black coarse hair, which seemed exactly
like that of a horse's tail. The hair on the small
front teeth was an inch long perhaps; on the
back teeth, it was from six to ten inches long.</p>

<p>Such teeth are beautifully adapted to the
animal's feeding habits. The baleen whale
feeds on a kind of jelly fish. We saw at times
the sea covered with these flat, round, whitish
living discs. The whale swims through an area
of this food with its mouth open. When it has
obtained a mouthful, it closes its jaws. The
water is forced out between the slab-like teeth;
the jelly fish remain tangled in the hair to be
gulped down.</p>

<p>Our first job after the cutting in of the whale
was to cut the baleen from the jaw. It was
cut away in bunches of ten or a dozen slabs held
together by the gums and stowed away in the
hold not to be touched again until later in the
voyage.</p>

<p><a id="fp144"></a><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="fig_caption">"Trying Out"</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[ 145 ]</a></span></p>

<p>While the baleen was being prepared for stowage,
the lid was removed from the try-works,
uncovering the two big copper caldrons. A
fire was started in the furnace with kindling and
a handful of coal, but kept going thereafter with
tried-out blubber called "scrap." Two men
dressed in oil-skins were sent down into the blubber-room
as the portion of the hold was called in
which the blanket pieces of blubber had been
stowed. Their oil-skins were to protect them
from the oil which oozed from the blubber. Oilskins,
however, are but slight protection as I
learned later when I was sent into the blubber
room at the taking of another whale. The oil
soaks through the water-proof oil-skins and saturates
one's clothes and goes clear through to
the skin leaving it as greasy as if it had been
rubbed with oil.</p>

<p>A whale's blubber lies immediately beneath
its skin, which is black and rubbery and about a
quarter of an inch thick. The blubber is packed
between this thin covering and the flesh in a layer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[ 146 ]</a></span>
of pink and opalescent fat from six inches to
two feet thick. The blubber is so full of oil that
the oil exudes from it. One can squeeze the oil
from a piece of raw blubber as water from a
sponge.</p>

<p>The two blubber-room men with short handled
spades cut the great blankets of blubber in what
in whaling parlance are called "horse pieces."
These horse pieces are two or three feet long
and about six inches wide. They are pitched
into tubs on deck and the tubs dragged forward
to the mincing vat. This is an immense oblong
tub across the top of which is fastened a plank.
Two sailors with mincing knives are stationed
at each end of the plank. The mincing knife
is like a carpenter's drawing knife, except that
the edge is on the outside. The sailor lays a
horse piece along the plank. Then grasping
the mincing knife by its two handles, he passes
the blade back and forth from side to side across
the blubber until it has been cut into leaves
something like those of a book, each leaf perhaps
a quarter of an inch thick and all of them
held together at the back by the black skin. Thus
minced the horse pieces are pitch-forked into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[ 147 ]</a></span>
the caldrons that are kept bubbling with boiling
oil. When the oil has been boiled out of them,
the horse-pieces, now shrunken and twisted into
hard, brittle lumps, called "scrap," are skimmed
off and thrown into a vat at the port side of the
try-works to be used later as fuel in trying out
the remainder of the blubber. The oil is ladled
off into a cooling vat at the starboard side where,
after it has cooled, it is siphoned into hogsheads
or tanks and these are later stowed in the
hold.</p>

<p>The trying out of the whale gave several delicacies
to the forecastle menu. Hardtack biscuit
soaked in buckets of sea water and then boiled
in the bubbling caldrons of oil made relishing
morsels. The crisp, tried-out blubber, which
looked like honey-comb, was palatable to some.
Black whale skin freed of blubber and cut into
small cubes and pickled in salt and vinegar had
a rather agreeable taste, though it was much
like eating pickled rubber. These things with
whale steaks and whale sausages made trying-out
days a season of continual feasting.</p>

<p>At night "scrap" was put into an iron basket
swung between the two chimneys of the try-works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[ 148 ]</a></span>
and set on fire, making a flaring yellow
blaze which lighted the ship from stem to stern
and threw weird shadows everywhere. The
beacon not only gave us plenty of light to work
by, but advertised the brig's good luck to any
ship which happened in sight of us. In the
blubber-room, holes were cut in a blanket piece
and rope yarns, having been rubbed upon the
blubber, were coiled in the hole and lighted. As
they burned they lighted the oil from the blubber.
These unique lamps had all the oil in a
ten-ton blanket piece to draw on. It was only
the wick that ever gave out. New strands of
rope yarn had to be provided from time to time.
Three or four of these lamps blazing and spluttering
made the blubber-room bright.</p>

<p>Working night and day, it took three days
to cut in and try out the whale. While the work
was going on, the decks were so greasy that we
could run and slide anywhere for long distances
like boys on ice. After the whale had been tried
out and the oil casks had been stowed below, we
fell upon the decks and paint work with lye and
water. Hard work soon had the ship looking
as bright as a new pin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">SHAKING HANDS WITH SIBERIA</p>


<p>The ship's prow was turned northward after
work on the whale had been finished.
I expected we would soon run into the ice
again. We sailed on and on, but not a block
of ice big enough to make a highball did we sight.
The white floes and drifts and the frozen continent
floating southward, along the coasts of
which we had cruised for whales and which had
surrounded us and held us captive for three
weeks, had disappeared entirely. The warm
water from the south, the southern winds, and
the spring sunshine had melted the ice. Its utter
disappearance savored of magic.</p>

<p>A long hilly coast rose ahead of us covered
with grass, barren of trees or shrubs, dotted with
blackened skeletons of old ice&mdash;an utterly desolate
land. It was Siberia. We put into a bight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[ 150 ]</a></span>
called St. Lawrence Bay. There was an Eskimo
village on the shore. The huts were made
of whale ribs covered with hides of walrus and
reindeer. In the warm weather, some of the
hides had been removed and we saw the white
gleaming bones of the frame work. We could
see the dogs with tails curling over their backs
frisking about and could hear their clamor as
they bayed the great white-winged thing that
had come up from over the sea's verge.</p>

<p>In this first part of July it was continuous
day. The sun set at eleven o'clock at night in
the northwest. Its disc remained barely below
the horizon&mdash;we could almost see its flaming rim.
A molten glow of color made the sky resplendent
just above it as it passed across the north
pole. It rose at 1:30 in the morning high in
the northeast. All the time it was down a brilliant
twilight prevailed&mdash;a twilight like that
which in our temperate zone immediately follows
the sinking of the sun behind a hill. We
could see to read without difficulty.</p>

<p>Soon boats and kyacks were putting off from
the village. When we were still a mile or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[ 151 ]</a></span>
out, strange craft came alongside and Eskimo
men, women, and children swarmed aboard.
Very picturesque they looked in clothes made
of the skins of reindeer, hair seals, dogs, and
squirrels, oddly trimmed and decorated with fur
mosaics in queer designs. Some of the women
wore over their furs a yellow water-proof cloak
made of the intestines of fish, ornamented with
needle-work figures and quite neat looking.</p>

<p>The men and the older women had animal
faces of low intelligence. The young girls were
extremely pretty, with glossy, coal-black hair,
bright black eyes, red cheeks, lips like ripe cherries,
and gleaming white teeth forever showing
in the laughter of irresponsibility and perfect
health.</p>

<p>The captain ordered a bucket of hardtack
brought out in honor of our guests. The biscuit
were dumped in a pile on the main deck.
The Eskimos gathered around in a solemn and
dignified circle. The old men divided the bread,
giving an equal number of hardtack to each.</p>

<p>This ceremony of welcome over, the Eskimos
were given the freedom of the ship, or at least,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[ 152 ]</a></span>
took it. We kept a careful watch upon them,
however, to see that they took nothing else.
Several of the Eskimo men had a sufficient smattering
of English to make themselves understood.
They had picked up their small vocabulary
among the whalers which every spring put
in at the little ports along the Siberian and
Alaskan coasts. One of them had been whaling
to the Arctic Ocean aboard a whale ship which
some accident had left short handed. He spoke
better English than any of the others and was
evidently regarded by his fellow townsmen as a
wonderfully intellectual person. He became
quite friendly with me, showing his friendship
by begging me to give him almost everything I
had, from tobacco to clothes. He constantly
used an Eskimo word the meaning of which all
whalers have learned and it assisted him materially
in telling his stories&mdash;he was a great story
teller. This word was "<i>pau</i>,"&mdash;it means "nothing."
I never knew before how important nothing
could be in human language. Here is a
sample of his use of "nothing:"</p>

<p><a id="fp152"></a><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/page152.png" width="599" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Callers from Asia</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[ 153 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Winter," he said, "sun pau; daylight pau.
All dark. Water pau; all ice. Land pau, all
snow. Eskimo igloo, plenty fire. Moss in
blubber oil all time blaze up. Cold pau. Plenty
hot. Eskimo, he sweat. Clothes pau. Good
time. Hot time. Eat plenty. Sleep."</p>

<p>This seemed to me a good, vivid description.
The picture was there, painted chiefly with
"nothing."</p>

<p>Of course he had the English words "yes"
and "no" in his assortment, but his way of using
them was pure Eskimo. For instance:
"You wear no clothes in winter?" I asked him.
"No," he replied. "No?" I echoed in surprise.
"Yes," he said. His "yes" merely affirmed his
"no." It sometimes required a devious mental
process to follow him.</p>

<p>A pretty girl came up to me with a smile and
an ingratiating air.</p>

<p>"Tobac," she said holding out her hand.</p>

<p>I handed her my smoking plug. She took
half of it at one cavernous bite and gave the remainder
back to me, which I thought considerate.
She enjoyed the tobacco. She chewed
upon it hard, working her jaws as if she were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[ 154 ]</a></span>
masticating a dainty tidbit. Did she expectorate?
Not a drop. She evidently did not propose
to waste any of the flavor of that good
weed. Neither did she get sick&mdash;that pretty
Eskimo girl. At last when she had chewed for
twenty minutes or so, she removed her quid and
stuck it behind her right ear. She chewed it at
intervals later on, always between times wearing
it conspicuously behind her ear.</p>

<p>I rather expected our guests would depart
after a call of an hour or so. Not so. They
had come to stay indefinitely. When they became
tired they lay on deck&mdash;it didn't make any
particular difference where&mdash;and went quietly
to sleep. They seemed to have no regular time
for sleeping. I found Eskimos asleep and
awake during all my deck watches. As it was
day all the twenty-four hours, I wondered if
these people without chronometers did not sometimes
get their hours mixed up.</p>

<p>New parties of Eskimos kept coming to see
us. One of these had killed a walrus and the
skin and the raw meat, butchered into portable
cuts, lay in the bottom of their big family canoe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[ 155 ]</a></span>
of hide. The boat was tied alongside and the
Eskimos came aboard. If any of them became
hungry, they climbed down into the canoe and
ate the raw walrus meat, smacking their lips
over it. When the sailors would lean over the
rail to watch this strange feat of gastronomy,
the Eskimos would smile up at them with
mouths smeared with blood and hold out a red
chunk in invitation. It was their joke.</p>

<p>We loafed in St. Lawrence Bay for more than
a week. We could not have sailed away if we
had wanted to, for all the time there was a windless
calm and the sea heaved and fell, unruffled
by a ripple, like a vast sheet of moving mercury.</p>

<p>It was weather characteristic of the Arctic
summer&mdash;a beautiful dream season of halcyon,
silver seas, opalescent haze, and tempered golden
sunlight. To the men in skin clothes, it was
warm weather, but one had only to step from
sunshine to shadow to pass from summer to winter.
One perspired in the sunlight; in the
shadow there was frost, and if the spot were
damp, a coating of ice.</p>

<p>I went duck hunting with a boat's crew one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[ 156 ]</a></span>
day. Mr. Winchester, who headed the boat,
was a good hand with a shotgun and brought
back a fine bag. One of the ducks, knocked
over on the wing, dropped within a few feet
of shore. When we rowed to pick it up, I
touched Siberia with an oar. I felt that it was
a sort of handshake with the Asiatic continent.
I never landed and never got any nearer.</p>

<p>In a little while, most of us had traded for a
number of nicely tanned hair-seal skins and had
set the Eskimo women and girls to work tailoring
trousers and vests and coats. It was marvelous
how dexterous they were at cutting and
sewing. They took no measurements and yet
their garments fitted rather snugly. Before
they began sewing they softened the edges of
the skins by chewing them. They wore their
thimble on their index finger and drove the
needle into one side of the skins and jerked it
through from the other side with such amazing
rapidity that the two movements seemed one.
A good seamstress&mdash;and all seemed remarkably
expert&mdash;could cut and sew a pair of trousers in
an hour, a bit of work it would have taken a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[ 157 ]</a></span>
sailor a day or two to accomplish. We could
hire a seamstress for an entire morning or afternoon
for five hardtack. A bowl of soup with a
piece of salt horse was sufficient pay for a day's
labor.</p>

<p>My old skin clothes, which I had obtained
from the slop-chest were greasy, dirty, and
worn and I had an Eskimo woman make me a
complete new outfit from hair-seal skins I purchased
from her husband. She cut out a coat,
vest, and trousers, spreading the skins on deck
and using a knife in cutting. She sat cross-legged
on deck most of the day sewing on the
garments and I carefully superintended the job.
She ornamented the coat with a black dogskin
collar and edged it down the breast and around
the bottom with the same material, which set off
the glistening seal skin attractively. I also
bought a new squirrel skin shirt with a hood attached.
When I appeared on deck in my new
toggery, I felt quite presentable.</p>

<p>However, I was not alone in gorgeous regalia.
Most of my shipmates were soon looking like
animate statues of silver in their shining seal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[ 158 ]</a></span>
skins. Our turns up and down deck became
fashion parades. We strutted like peacocks, it
must be admitted, and displayed our fine clothes
to best advantage under the eyes of the Eskimo
beauties.</p>

<p>It remained for Peter, our rolypoly little
Swede, to make the only real, simon-pure conquest.
In his new clothes, which sparkled like
a silver dollar fresh from the mint, and with his
fresh boyish face, he cut quite a handsome figure
and one little Eskimo maid fell a victim to his
fatal fascinations. "'E's killed her dead," said
English Bill White. She was perhaps fifteen
years old, roguish eyed, rosy cheeked, and with
coal-black hair parted in the middle and falling
in two braids at the sides of her head. Plump
and full of life and high spirits, the gay little
creature was as pretty as any girl I saw among
the Eskimos.</p>

<p>Peter was all devotion. He gave his sweetheart
the lion's share of all his meals, feasting
her on salt horse, hardtack, soup, and gingerbread
which to her primitive palate that never
had risen to greater gastronomic heights than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[ 159 ]</a></span>
blubber and raw meat must have seemed epicurean
delicacies. The sailors called the girl
"Mamie," which was very different from the
Eskimo name her mother spluttered at her. If
Peter was missed at any time, it was only necessary
to locate the charming Miss Mamie, and
there by her side Peter would be found, speaking
only with his eyes and making distinct progress.</p>

<p>Sometimes Peter, finding optical language
not entirely satisfactory, pressed into his service
the intellectual Eskimo as interpreter. These
three-cornered efforts at love making were
amusing to all who chanced to overhear them;&mdash;the
dashing young Romeo could scarcely talk
English himself, the interpreter could talk even
less and the object of Peter's adoration could
not speak a word.</p>

<p>As the upshot of this interesting affair, the little
lady and Peter plotted between them that
Peter should run away from the ship and live
among her people. This plan appealed to Peter
who was a cold weather product himself and
almost as primitive as his inamorata. But Peter
made one mistake;&mdash;he took old Nels Nelson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[ 160 ]</a></span>
his countryman and side-partner, into his confidence.
Nelson loved the boy like a father and
did his best to persuade him to give up the idea,
but Peter was determined.</p>

<p>One twilight midnight with the sun just skimming
below the horizon, Peter wrapped from
head to foot in an Eskimo woman's mackintosh
of fish intestine, with the hood over his head and
half hiding his chubby face, climbed over the rail
into an Eskimo boat with a number of natives,
his sweetheart among them, and set out for
shore. Nelson and several sailors watched the
boat paddle away, but no one but Nelson knew
that the person bundled up in the native raincoat
was Peter. The boat got half a mile from
the brig. Then Nelson could stand it no longer.
The strain was too much. He rushed back to
the quarter-deck where old Gabriel was walking
up and down.</p>

<p>"Peter's run away," Nelson blurted out.
"There he goes in that boat. That's him
dressed up like a woman in fish-gut oil-skins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[ 161 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Without ado Gabriel called aft the watch,
manned a boat, and set out in pursuit. The
Eskimo canoe was quickly overhauled and Peter
was captured and brought back aboard.</p>

<p>"You ben bigges' fool for sech a li'l' boy I
ever have see," said Gabriel severely. "You
don't know you freeze to deaf up here in winter
time, no?"</p>

<p>Peter had nothing to say. He was ashamed,
but he was mad, too. He was not punished.
When Captain Shorey learned of the escapade,
he merely laughed. Peter took the matter
quite to heart and pouted for days. To the end
of the voyage, he still dreamed of his Eskimo
sweetheart and of the happiness that might have
been his. Every time he spoke of her his eyes
grew bright. "She was fine gal," he used to
say.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">MOONSHINE AND HYGIENE</p>


<p>We noticed that several of our Eskimo
guests appeared at times to be slightly
under the influence of liquor and
thought perhaps they had obtained gin or rum
from some whaling vessel that had touched at
the port before we arrived. We asked the intellectual
Eskimo where these fellows had got
their booze. He pointed to an Eskimo and
said, "Him."</p>

<p>"Him" was a lordly person dressed in elaborately
trimmed and ornamented skin clothes.
From the way he strutted about, we had fancied
him a chief. He turned out be a "moonshiner."</p>

<p>This doubtless will surprise those whose ideas
of "moonshiners" are associated with southern
Appalachian ranges, lonely mountain coves, revenue
raids, and romance. But here was an Eskimo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[ 163 ]</a></span>
"moonshiner" who made unlicensed whiskey
under the midnight sun and yet was as genuine
a "moonshiner" as any lawless southern
mountaineer. The sailors, being thirsty souls,
at once opened negotiations with him for liquor.
He drew from beneath his deer-skin coat a skin
bottle filled with liquor and sold it to us for fifteen
hardtack. Wherefore there was, for a
time, joy in the forecastle&mdash;in limited quantity,
for the bottle was small. This product of the
ice-bound North was the hottest stuff I ever
tasted.</p>

<p>The captain was not long in discovering that
the Eskimo had liquor to sell and sent a boat
ashore with a demijohn. The jug was brought
back filled with Siberian "moonshine," which
had been paid for with a sack of flour. The
boat's crew found on the beach a little distillery
in comparison with which the pot stills of the
Kentucky and Tennessee mountains, made of
old kitchen kettles would seem elaborate and
up-to-date plants. The still itself was an old
tin oil can; the worm, a twisted gun barrel; the
flake-stand, a small powder keg. The mash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[ 164 ]</a></span>
used in making the liquor, we learned, was a fermented
mixture of flour and molasses obtained
in trade from whale ships. It was boiled in the
still, a twist of moss blazing in a pan of blubber
oil doing duty as a furnace. The vapor from
the boiling mash passed through the worm in
the flake-stand and was condensed by ice-cold
water with which the powder keg was kept constantly
filled by hand. The liquor dripped
from the worm into a battered old tomato can.
It was called "kootch" and was potently intoxicating.
An Eskimo drunk on "kootch"
was said to be brave enough to tackle a polar
bear, single-handed. The little still was operated
in full view of the villagers. There was no
need of secrecy. Siberia boasted no revenue
raiders.</p>

<p>The owner of the plant did an extensive trade
up and down the coast and it was said natives
from Diomede Islands and Alaska paddled over
in their canoes and <i>bidarkas</i> to buy his liquor.
They paid for it in walrus tusk ivory, whale
bone, and skins and the "moonshiner" was the
richest man in all that part of Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[ 165 ]</a></span></p>

<p>If contact with civilization had taught the Eskimo
the art of distillation and drunkenness, it
also had improved living conditions among
them. Many owned rifles. Their spears and
harpoons were steel tipped. They bartered for
flour, molasses, sugar, and all kinds of canned
goods with the whale ships every summer.
They had learned to cook. There was a stove
in the village. The intellectual Eskimo boasted
of the stove as showing the high degree of civilization
achieved by his people. The stove, be it
added, was used chiefly for heating purposes
in winter and remained idle in summer. The
natives regarded the cooked foods of the white
man as luxuries to be indulged in only occasionally
in a spirit of connoisseurship. They still
preferred their immemorial diet of blubber and
raw meat.</p>

<p>Aside from these faint touches of civilization,
the Eskimos were as primitive in their life and
mental processes as people who suddenly had
stepped into the present out of the world of
ten thousand years ago. I fancy Adam and
Eve would have lived after the manner of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[ 166 ]</a></span>
Eskimos if the Garden of Eden had been close
to the North Pole.</p>

<p>There is apparently no government or law
among these Eskimos. They have no chiefs.
When it becomes necessary to conduct any business
of public importance with outsiders, it is
looked after by the old men. The Eskimos are
a race, one may say, of individuals. Each one
lives his life according to his own ideas; without
let or hindrance. Each is a law unto himself.
Under these conditions one might expect they
would hold to the rule of the strong arm under
which might makes right. This is far from true.
There is little crime among them. Murder is
extremely rare. Though they sometimes steal
from white men&mdash;the sailors on the brig were
warned that they would steal anything not nailed
down&mdash;they are said never&mdash;or hardly ever&mdash;to
steal from each other. They have a nice respect
for the rights of their neighbors. They are not
exactly a Golden Rule people, but they mind
their own business.</p>

<p>The infrequency of crime among them seems
stranger when one learns that they never punish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[ 167 ]</a></span>
their children. Eskimo children out-Topsy
Topsy in "just growing." I was informed that
they are never spanked, cuffed, or boxed on the
ears. Their little misdemeanors are quietly ignored.
It might seem logical to expect these
ungoverned and lawless little fellows to grow up
into bad men and women. But the ethical tradition
of the race holds them straight.</p>

<p>When a crime occurs, the punishment meted
out fits it as exactly as possible. We heard of a
murder among the Eskimos around St. Lawrence
Bay the punishment of which furnishes a
typical example of Eskimo justice. A young
man years before had slain a missionary by
shooting him with a rifle. The old men of the
tribe tried the murderer and condemned him to
death. His own father executed the sentence
with the same rifle with which the missionary
had been killed.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis is a greater scourge among the
Eskimos than among the peoples of civilization.
This was the last disease I expected to find in
the cold, pure air of the Arctic region. But I
was told that it caused more than fifty per cent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168 ]</a></span>
of the deaths among the natives. These conditions
have been changed for the better within the
last few years. School teachers, missionaries, and
traveling physicians appointed by the United
States government have taught the natives of
Alaska hygiene and these have passed on the
lesson to their kinsmen of Siberia. Long after
my voyage had ended, Captain A. J. Henderson,
of the revenue cutter <i>Thetis</i> and a pioneer
judge of Uncle Sam's "floating court" in Behring
Sea and Arctic Ocean waters, told me of
the work he had done in spreading abroad the
gospel of health among the Eskimos.</p>

<p>Finding tuberculosis carrying off the natives
by wholesale, Captain Henderson began the
first systematic crusade against the disease during
a summer voyage of his vessel in the north.
In each village at which the <i>Thetis</i> touched, he
took the ship's doctor ashore and had him deliver
through an interpreter a lecture on tuberculosis.
Though the Eskimos lived an out-door life in
summer, they shut themselves up in their igloos
in winter, venturing out only when necessity
compelled them, and living in a super-heated atmosphere
without ventilation. As a result their
winter igloos became veritable culture beds of
the disease.</p>

<p><a id="fp168"></a><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 599px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[ 169 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Those afflicted had no idea what was the matter
with them. Their witch doctors believed
that they were obsessed by devils and attempted
by incantations to exorcise the evil spirits. The
doctor of the <i>Thetis</i> had difficulty in making the
natives understand that the organism that caused
their sickness was alive, though invisible. But
he did succeed in making them understand that
the disease was communicated by indiscriminate
expectoration and that prevention and cure lay
in plenty of fresh air, cleanliness, and wholesome
food.</p>

<p>In all the villages, Captain Henderson found
the igloos offensively filthy and garbage and
offal scattered about the huts in heaps. He made
the Eskimos haul these heaps to sea in boats and
dump them overboard. He made them clean
their igloos thoroughly and take off the roofs
to allow the sun and rains to purify the interiors.
After this unroofing, Captain Henderson said,
the villages looked as if a cyclone had struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[ 170 ]</a></span>
them. He taught the natives how to sew together
sputum cups of skin and cautioned the
afflicted ones against expectoration except in
these receptacles.</p>

<p>The Eskimos were alive to the seriousness of
the situation and did their utmost to follow out
these hygienic instructions to the last detail. As
a result of this first missionary campaign in the
cause of health, the Eskimos have begun to keep
their igloos clean and to ventilate them in winter.
There has grown up among them an unwritten
law against indiscriminate expectoration more
carefully observed than such ordinances in
American cities. The villages have been gradually
turned into open-air sanitariums and the
death rate from tuberculosis has been materially
reduced.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">NEWS FROM HOME</p>


<p>With the first breeze, we set sail for
Port Clarence, Alaska, the northern
rendezvous of the Arctic Ocean whaling
fleet in early summer. There in the latter
part of June or the early part of July, the fleet
always met the four-masted schooner <i>Jennie</i>,
the tender from San Francisco, by which all
firms in the whaling trade sent mail and supplies
to their vessels. On our way across from
Siberia to Alaska, we passed just south of
Behring Straits and had our first distant glimpse
of the Arctic Ocean. When we dropped anchor
in the windy roadstead of Port Clarence, eighteen
whale ships were there ahead of us.</p>

<p>The land about Port Clarence was flat and
covered with tall, rank grass&mdash;a region of tundra
stretching away to distant hills. The <i>Jennie</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[ 172 ]</a></span>
came in direct from San Francisco soon after
we arrived. Boats from the whale ships
swarmed about her as soon as she dropped anchor,
eager for letters and newspapers. Our
mate brought back a big bundle of San Francisco
newspapers which were sent forward after
the cabin had read them. They gave us our
first news since leaving Honolulu of how the
great world was wagging. Every man in the
forecastle who could read read these papers
from the first headline to the last advertisement.
It seemed good to get into touch once more with
the men and events of civilization. Exiles of
the sea, the news of our country seemed to have
an intimate personal meaning to us which it
never could possibly have to stay-at-homes to
whom newspapers are every-day, casual budgets
of gossip and information. I remember that a
telegraphic brevity describing a murder in my
native state seemed like a message from home.</p>

<p>Among the Eskimos who came aboard the
brig from the large village on shore, was a white
man dressed like an Eskimo to the last detail
and looking like one except for a heavy beard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[ 173 ]</a></span>
He had run away from a whale ship three years
before, hoping to make his way to some white
settlement to the south and there secure passage
on shipboard back to San Francisco. He had
escaped, he said, in an Eskimo kyack tied alongside
his ship. As soon as he was missed officers
and boatsteerers put ashore in a boat and trailed
him. He led his pursuers a long chase inland
and though he was shot at several times, he managed
to elude them and reach the safety of the
hills.</p>

<p>After he had seen the whaling fleet sail away,
he ventured back to the Eskimo village on shore
where he was welcomed by the natives. He
soon found that escape by land was practically
impossible; the nearest white settlement was
hundreds of miles distant and he would have to
thread his way through pathless forests and
across ranges of mountains covered at all seasons
with ice and snow. Moreover, he learned
what he should have known before he ran away
that no vessels except whaling ships, their tender,
and an occasional revenue cutter ever
touched at Port Clarence which at that time was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[ 174 ]</a></span>
far north of the outmost verge of the world's
commerce. There was nothing left for him to
do but settle among the Eskimos and wait for
the arrival of the whaling fleet in the following
summer.</p>

<p>During the long Arctic night, with the temperature
forty and fifty degrees below zero, he
lived in an igloo after the manner of the natives;
learned to eat raw meat and blubber&mdash;there was
nothing else to eat&mdash;became fluent in the Eskimo
language; and took an Eskimo girl for a
wife. He found existence among these human
anachronisms left over from the stone age a
monotonously dreary and soul-wearying experience,
and he waited with nervous impatience for
the coming of the fleet with its annual opportunity
for getting back to civilization.</p>

<p>The first year passed and the ships anchored in
Port Clarence. He hurried out in his kyack to
ask the Captains for permission to work his way
back to San Francisco. He never once doubted
that they would give him his chance. But a
sad surprise was in store for him. From ship to
ship he went, begging to be allowed to remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[ 175 ]</a></span>
aboard, but the hard-hearted captains coldly refused
him, one after the other. He was a deserter,
they told him; he had made his bed and
he could lie in it; to take him away would encourage
others to desert. Some captains cursed
him; some ordered him off their vessels. Finally
the ships sailed away for the whaling
grounds, leaving him marooned on the bleak
shore to pass another year in the squalor of his
igloo.</p>

<p>Next year when the whaling fleet came again
it was the same story over again. Again he
watched the ships arrive with a heart beating
high with hope and again he saw their topmasts
disappear over the horizon, leaving him hopeless
and wretched behind. Before he came aboard
the brig, he had made the rounds of the other
ships and had met with the same refusals as of
yore. I saw him go aft and plead with Captain
Shorey and that stern old sea dog turned him
down as curtly as the other skippers had done.
The ships sailed away, leaving him to his fate.
To me his story was the most pathetic that ever
fell within my personal experience. I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[ 176 ]</a></span>
learned whether he ever managed somehow to
get back home or left his bones to bleach upon
the frozen tundra.</p>

<p>From Port Clarence, we headed back to Unalaska
to ship our whale bone to San Francisco
by steamer. Midway of our run down the
Behring Sea a thick fog closed about us and we
kept our fog horn booming. Soon, off our
bows, we heard another fog horn. It seemed to
be coming closer. Our cooper, an old navy bugler,
became suspicious. He got out his old
bugle and sounded "assembly" sharply. As
the first note struck into the mist, the other fog
horn ceased its blowing. We did not hear it
again. When the mist lifted, no vessel was in
sight, but the situation was clear. We had
chanced upon a poaching sealer and when she
heard our cooper's bugle, she concluded we were
a revenue cutter and took to her heels.</p>

<p><a id="fp176"></a><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[ 177 ]</a></span></p>

<p>A day or two later, we saw the revenue cutter
<i>Corwin</i> chasing a poacher. Heeled over under
crowded sail, the sealing schooner was scurrying
before a stiff wind. The <i>Corwin</i> was plowing
in hot pursuit, smoke pouring from her funnel
and hanging thick in the wake of the chase.
She was gaining steadily, for she was a steamship
and the schooner had only her sails to depend
on. Finally the revenue cutter sent a
solid shot across the schooner's bows. The ball
knocked up a great splash of water. But the
poacher did not heave to&mdash;just kept on her way,
leaning so far over that the clews of her lower
sails almost touched the waves and a big white
feather of spray stood up in front of her. So
pursuer and pursued passed over the horizon
and we did not see the end of the hunt. But
we knew that there could be but one end. The
fate of that poacher was sealed. Only a fog
could save her, and the sky was clear.</p>

<p>We passed close to St. George Island, the
southernmost of the Pribiloff group, the breeding
place of the fur seals. As we came near the
shores, the air literally shook with the raucous,
throbbing bark of countless seals. The din was
deafening. Along the shore, a shelving beach
ran up to rocky declivities and beach and rocks
were packed with seals. There may have been
a hundred thousand; there may have been a million;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[ 178 ]</a></span>
and it seemed as if every seal was barking.
The water alongshore swarmed with them.
Thousands of heads were sticking out of the sea.
Thousands of other seals were playing, breaching
out of the water like porpoises. They swam
close to the brig and floated lazily on the surface,
staring at us unafraid. If we had been poachers,
I should think we could have taken several
hundred thousand dollars worth of seals without
difficulty.</p>

<p>A dozen little pup seals whose fur was of a
snowy and unspotted white came swimming
about the vessel. These sea babies were soft,
furry, cunning little fellows and they paddled
about the brig, sniffing at the strange monster
that had invaded their home. They seemed absolutely
fearless and gazed up at us out of big,
brown, wondering, friendly eyes. Sealers kill
them, as their fur makes beautiful edgings and
borders for fur garments.</p>

<p>The fur seals are supposed to pass the winter
somewhere in the South Pacific, but whether in
the open sea or on land has never been definitely
learned. From their mysterious southern hiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[ 179 ]</a></span>
places, they set out for the North in the
early spring. They first appear in March in
the waters off California. Coastwise vessels
find the sea alive with thousands of them. They
travel slowly northward following the coast line,
fifty or a hundred miles out at sea, feeding on
fish and sleeping on the surface. Regularly
each year in April, a revenue cutter setting out
from Port Townsend for patrol service in
Behring Sea and Arctic Ocean waters, picks up
the herd and convoys it to the Pribiloffs to guard
it against the attacks of poachers. The seals
swarm through the passes between the Aleutian
islands in May and arrive at the Pribiloffs in
the latter part of that month or early in June.</p>

<p>They remain on the Pribiloffs during the
breeding and rearing season and begin to depart
for the South again in the latter part of September.
They are all gone as a rule by November,
though in some years the last ones do not
leave until December. They are again seen as
they crowd through the Aleutian channels, but
all track of them is lost a few hundred miles to
the south. At what destination they finally arrive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[ 180 ]</a></span>
on that southward exodus no man knows.
It is one of the mysteries of the sea.</p>

<p>We saw no whales on our southward passage
and did not much expect to see any, though we
kept a lookout at the mast-head on the off
chance of sighting some lone spout. The summer
months are a second "between seasons,"
dividing the spring whaling in Behring Sea from
that in the Arctic Ocean in the fall. The
whales had all followed the retreating ice northward
through Behring Straits.</p>

<p>The Fourth of July found us in the middle
of Behring Sea. We observed the glorious
Fourth by hoisting the American flag to our
gaff-topsail peak, where it fluttered all day long.
Mr. Winchester came forward with two bottles
of Jamaica rum and dealt out a drink all
around.</p>

<p>We entered Unalaska harbor by the same
long, narrow, and precipitous channel through
which we had passed on our voyage north when
we put into the harbor to have the captain's leg
set. Negotiating this channel&mdash;I should say it
was about two miles long&mdash;was another illustration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[ 181 ]</a></span>
of our captain's seamanship. We had to
tack innumerable times from one side of the
channel to the other, our jib-boom at every tack
projecting over the land before the brig came
around. We finally dropped anchor opposite
the old, cross-crowned Greek church which
stands in the center of the struggling village.</p>

<p class="caption3">SLIM GOES ON STRIKE</p>


<p>It was the heart of the Arctic summer and
the high hills that rose all about the town
were green with deep grass&mdash;it looked as if
it would reach a man's waist&mdash;and ablaze with
wild flowers. I was surprised to see such a riot
of blooms in this far northern latitude, but there
they were, and every off-shore breeze was sweet
with their fragrance. The village was dingy
enough, but the country looked alluring and, as
the day after we dropped anchor was Sunday
and nothing to do aboard, the crew decided to
ask for a day's liberty ashore. Bill White, the
Englishman, and Slim, our Royal Life Guardsman,
agreed to act as the forecastle's ambassadors
to the cabin. They dressed up in their
smartest clothes and went aft to interview Captain
Shorey on the quarter-deck. White made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[ 183 ]</a></span>
the speech of the occasion and proffered the
forecastle's request in his best rhetoric. Captain
Shorey puffed silently at his cigar. "I'll
see about it," he said. That closed the incident
as far as the captain was concerned. We got
no shore leave.</p>

<p>As the day wore away and the desired permission
failed to materialize, the forecastle became
piqued at what it considered the skipper's gratuitous
ungraciousness. Slim waxed particularly
indignant.</p>

<p>"He'll 'see about it,'" Slim sneered. "He
never had no idea of letting us go in the first
place. He's a cold-blooded son of a sea cook&mdash;that's
what he is&mdash;and as for me, I'll never do
another tap of work aboard the bloody hooker."</p>

<p>This was strong language. Of course, none
of us took it seriously, feeling sure Slim would
reconsider by the next morning and turn to for
work with the rest of us. But we did not know
Slim. Bright and early Monday morning, the
men mustered on deck and went to work, but
Slim remained in his bunk.</p>

<p>Having rowed our whale bone to the dock and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[ 184 ]</a></span>
stored it in a warehouse to await the first steamer
for San Francisco, a boat's crew towed three or
four hogsheads roped together ashore for water.
Another boat went ashore for coal. Those left
aboard the brig were put to work in the hold
near the main hatch under the supervision of
Mr. Winchester. The mate suddenly noted
Slim's absence.</p>

<p>"Where's Slim?" he asked.</p>

<p>Nobody answered.</p>

<p>"He didn't go ashore in the boats," said the
mate. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>Someone volunteered that Slim was sick.</p>

<p>"Sick, eh?" said the mate.</p>

<p>He hustled off to the forecastle scuttle.</p>

<p>"Slim," he sang out, "what's the matter with
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sick," responded Slim from his bunk.</p>

<p>"If you're sick," said the mate, "come aft
and report yourself sick to the captain."</p>

<p>In a little while, Slim shuffled back to the
cabin. A few minutes later wild yells came
from the cabin. We stopped work. The mate
seemed to think we might rush to the rescue.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[ 185 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get busy there," he roared. "Slew that
cask around."</p>

<p>The yells broke off. We went to work again.
For a half hour, there was silence in the cabin.
We wondered what had happened. Slim might
have been murdered for all we knew. Finally
Slim emerged and went silently forward. We
noticed a large shaved spot on the top of his
head where two long strips of court-plaster
formed a black cross.</p>

<p>The first thing Slim did after getting back to
the forecastle was to take one of his blue flannel
shirts and, while none of the officers was looking,
shin up the ratlines and hang it on the fore-lift.
This is an old-time sailor sign of distress
and means trouble aboard. The mate soon
spied the shirt swinging in the breeze.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be darned," he said. "Jump up
there one of you and take that shirt down."</p>

<p>No one stirred. The mate called the cabin
boy and the young Kanaka brought down the
shirt. Slim told us at dinner time all about his
adventure in the cabin.</p>

<p>"I goes down in the cabin," said Slim, "and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186 ]</a></span>
the captain is standing with his hands in his
pants pockets, smiling friendly-like. 'Hello,
Slim,' he says. 'Sit down in this chair.' I sits
down and the captain says, 'Well, my boy,
what's the matter with you?' 'I'm sick,' says
I. 'Where do you feel bad?' he says. 'I ache
all over,' says I. He steps over in front of me,
still with that little smile on his face. 'I've got
good medicine aboard this ship,' he says, 'and I'll
fix you up in a jiffy, my boy,' says he. With
that he jerks one of his hands out of his pocket
and he has a revolver clutched in it. 'Here's
the medicine you need,' he says and he bats me
over the cocoanut with the gun.</p>

<p>"The blood spurts all over me and I jumps
up and yells, but the captain points his pistol
at me and orders me to sit down again. He
storms up and down the cabin floor. 'I'll teach
you who's master aboard this ship,' he shouts
and for a minute he was so purple in the face
with rage, I thought he was going to murder me
for sure. By and by he cools down. 'Well,
Slim,' he says, 'I guess I hit you a little harder
than I meant to, but I'm a bad man when I get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[ 187 ]</a></span>
started. You need tending to now, sure
enough.'</p>

<p>"So he has the cabin boy fetch a pan of warm
water and he washes the blood out of my hair
with his own hands and then shaves around the
cut and pastes sticking plaster on. That's all.
But say, will I have the law on him when we get
back to Frisco? Will I?"</p>

<p>It was a long way back to Frisco. In the
meantime we wondered what was in store for
the luckless Irish grenadier.</p>

<p>That afternoon, the revenue cutter <i>Corwin</i>
came steaming into port towing a poaching
sealer as a prize. It was the same schooner,
we learned, we had seen the <i>Corwin</i> chasing a
few days before. As the cutter passed us, Slim
sprang on the forecastle head while Captain
Shorey and everybody aboard the brig looked at
him and, waving a blue flannel shirt frantically,
shouted: "Please come aboard. I've had
trouble aboard." "Aye, aye," came back across
the water from the government patrol vessel.
Waving a shirt has no significance in sea tradition,
but Slim was not enough of a sailor to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[ 188 ]</a></span>
know that, and besides, he wanted to leave nothing
undone to impress the revenue cutter officers
with the urgency of his case.</p>

<p>No sooner had the <i>Corwin</i> settled to her berth
at the pier than a small boat with bluejackets
at the oars, two officers in gold braid and epaulettes
in the stern, and with the stars and stripes
flying, shot out from under her quarter and
headed for the brig.</p>

<p>"Aha," we chuckled. "Captain Shorey has
got his foot in it. He has Uncle Sam to deal
with now. He won't hit him over the head with
a revolver."</p>

<p>The boat came alongside and the officers
climbed over the rail. Captain Shorey welcomed
them with a smile and elaborate courtesy
and ushered them into the cabin. Slim was sent
for.</p>

<p>"Tell 'em everything, Slim," we urged.
"Give it to the captain hot and heavy. He's a
brute and the revenue cutter men will take you
off the brig as sure as shooting. They won't
dare leave you aboard to lead a dog's life for
the rest of the voyage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[ 189 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll show him up, all right," was Slim's parting
shot.</p>

<p>Slim came back from the cabin a little later.</p>

<p>"I told 'em everything," he said. "They
listened to everything I had to say and took
down a lot of notes in a book. I asked 'em to
take me off the brig right away, for, says I,
Captain Shorey will kill me if they leave me
aboard. I guess they'll take me off."</p>

<p>An hour later, the two officers of the <i>Corwin</i>
emerged from the cabin, accompanied by Captain
Shorey. They were puffing complacently
at a couple of the captain's cigars. They
seemed in high good humor. After shaking
hands with Captain Shorey, they climbed down
into their boat and were rowed back to their
vessel. That was the last we ever saw of them.
Poor Slim was left to his fate.</p>

<p>And his fate was a rough one. There was
no outward change in the attitude of the captain
or the officers of the brig toward him. Whenever
they spoke to him, they did it with as much
civility as they showed the rest of us. But Slim
was compelled to work on deck all day and stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190 ]</a></span>
his regular night watches into the bargain. That
meant he got eight hours sleep during twenty-four
hours one day and four hours sleep during
the next. As the ship was in whaling waters
from now on, the crew had little to do except
man the boats. But Slim always had plenty
to do. While we smoked our pipes and lounged
about, he was kept washing paint work, slushing
down masts, scraping deck and knocking the
rust off the anchors. Any one of a hundred
and one little jobs that didn't need doing, Slim
did. This continued until the brig squared her
yards for the homeward voyage. Slim had more
than three months of it. The Lord knows it
was enough. When his nagging finally ended,
he was a pale, haggard shadow of his former self.
It almost killed him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">INTO THE ARCTIC</p>


<p>From Unalaska, we headed north for the
Arctic Ocean. For one day of calm, we
lay again off the little Eskimo village of
St. Lawrence Bay and again had the natives as
our guests. Peter made an elaborate toilet in
expectation of seeing once more his little Eskimo
sweetheart, but she did not come aboard.
A little breeze came walking over the sea and
pushed us on northward. On August 15, we
sailed through Behring Straits and were at last
in the Arctic.</p>

<p>The straits are thirty-six miles wide, with East
Cape, a rounded, dome-shaped mass of black
basalt, on the Asiatic side and on the American
side Cape Prince of Wales, a headland of
sharper outline, but neither so lofty nor so sheer.
In between the two capes and in line with them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[ 192 ]</a></span>
lie the two islands of Big and Little Diomede.
Through the three narrow channels between the
capes and the islands, the tide runs with the
swiftness of a river's current.</p>

<p>The Eskimos constantly cross from continent
to continent in small boats. In still weather the
passage can be made in a light kyack with perfect
safety. The widest of the three channels
is that between Big Diomede and East Cape
and is, I should say, not more than fifteen miles
across. While we were passing through the
straits, we saw a party of Eskimos in a skin boat
paddling leisurely across from America to Asia.
They no doubt had been on a visit to relatives
or friends on the neighboring continent. We
were told that in winter when the straits are
frozen solidly, the Eskimos frequently walk from
one continent to the other.</p>

<p><a id="fp192"></a><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[ 193 ]</a></span></p>

<p>While we were sailing close to the American
shore soon after passing through the straits, the
cry of "Walrus, walrus!" from the mast-head
sent the crew hurrying to the rail to catch a
glimpse of these strange creatures which we had
not before encountered. We were passing an
immense herd. The shore was crowded with
giant bulks, lying perfectly still in the sun, while
the waters close to land were alive with bobbing
heads. At a distance and at first glance, those
on shore looked like a vast herd of cattle resting
after grazing. They were as big as oxen and
when the sun had dried them, they were of a
pronounced reddish color. Those in the water
looked black.</p>

<p>They had a way of sticking their heads and
necks straight up out of the sea which was
slightly suggestive of men treading water.
Their heads seemed small for their great bodies
and with their big eyes, their beard-like mass of
thick bristles about the nose, and their long
ivory tusks they had a distinctly human look
despite their grotesque ugliness. They lifted
their multitudinous voices in gruff, barking roars
like so many bulldogs affected with a cold.
There must have been 10,000 of them. They
paid little attention to the ship. Those on shore
remained as motionless as boulders.</p>

<p>"Want to collect a little ivory?" Captain
Shorey said with a smile to Mr. Winchester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[ 194 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, thank you, not just now," replied the
mate. "I want to live to get back to
'Frisco."</p>

<p>An ivory hunter among those tusked thousands
doubtless would have fared disastrously.
Walrus are famous fighters. When attacked,
they sometimes upset a boat with their tusks
and drown the hunters. They are dangerous
even in small herds. Moreover they are difficult
to kill. Their thick hides will turn a bullet
that does not hit them solidly. Though slow
and unwieldy on land or ice, they are surprisingly
agile in the water and a harpooned walrus
will frequently tow a boat at a dizzy clip.</p>

<p>The region about Cape Prince of Wales is a
favorite feeding ground for the animals. The
coasts swarm with clams, mussels, and other
shell-fish upon which the walrus live. Thirteen
varieties of edible clams, it is said, have been discovered
by scientists about Cape Prince of
Wales. The walrus dig these shell-fish out of
the sand and rocks with their tusks, crush them
with their teeth, eject the shells, and swallow
the dainty tidbits. Their tusks serve them also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[ 195 ]</a></span>
as weapons of defense and as hooks by which
to haul themselves upon ice floes.</p>

<p>We did not dare take chances in the boats
among such vast numbers of these formidable
creatures and soon left the great herd astern.
A little higher up the coast we ran into a small
herd numbering about a hundred, and Mr. Winchester,
armed with his repeating rifle, lowered
his boat to have a try for ivory.</p>

<p>When the mate's boat dashed among the animals
they did not dive or run away, but held
their ground, standing well up out of water and
coughing out defiance. Long John darted a
harpoon into one of the beasts and it plunged
below and went scurrying away. One might
have thought the boat was fast to a young whale
from the way the line sizzled out over the bow.
The walrus dragged the boat about half a mile,
and when the animal again came to the surface
for air Mr. Winchester killed it with a bullet.</p>

<p>But the blood and the shooting had thrown
the remainder of the herd into violent excitement.
Roaring furiously, the great beasts converged
from all sides in the wake of the chase.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[ 196 ]</a></span>
By the time Long John had cut off the head of
the dead walrus and heaved it aboard and had
recovered his harpoon, the animals were swarming
menacingly about the boat. Long John,
who had been in such ticklish situations before,
began to beat a tattoo on the gunwales with his
sheath knife, at the same time emitting a series
of blood-curdling yells. This was intended to
awe the boat's besiegers and had a momentary
effect. The brutes stood in the water apparently
puzzled, but still roaring savagely. But
they were not long to be held off by mere noise.
Led by a monster bull, they rushed at the boat in
a concerted attack. The sailors belabored them
over the head with the sweeps. The mate pumped
lead into them from his rifle. Still they came on.</p>

<p>When Captain Shorey, who had been watching
the battle from the quarter-deck, saw how
serious the situation was becoming, he grew
alarmed.</p>

<p>"Those men will be killed," he shouted to
Mr. Landers. "Call the watch and lower those
other boats, and be quick about it."</p>

<p>In a jiffy the boats were lowered, the crews
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[ 197 ]</a></span>
piled in, masts were stepped, and we shot away
to the rescue. But the mate's crew solved their
own problem before we could come into action.
When it seemed likely the walrus would swamp
the boat, Long John harpooned the leader of the
herd. The big walrus dived and made off, hauling
the boat out of the midst of the furious
brutes to safety. The other animals did not pursue.
They bobbed about the scene of the conflict
for some time and finally disappeared. Long
John killed the big bull to which the boat was
fast, cut off its head, and the boat went back to
the battleground to take similar toll of the walrus
that had died under the mate's rain of bullets.
Eight carcasses were found afloat and as
many more probably had sunk.</p>

<p>Ten heads with their ivory tusks were brought
aboard the brig as trophies of the hunt. The
tusks of the bull that had led the attack measured
two feet six inches. The animal, according
to Mr. Winchester, must have been ten or twelve
feet long. The mate estimated its weight at
1,800 pounds&mdash;a guess, of course, but perhaps
a close one.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">BLUBBER AND SONG</p>


<p>We were cruising in open water soon
afterward with two whaling ships in
sight, the <i>Reindeer</i> and the <i>Helen
Marr</i>, both barkentines and carrying five boats
each, when we raised a school of bowheads
straight ahead and about five miles distant.
There were twenty-five or thirty whales and a
broad patch of sea was covered with their incessant
fountains. The other ships saw them about
the same time. The long-drawn, musical "Blo-o-o-w!"
from their mastheads came to us across
the water. Aboard the brig, the watch was
called and all hands were mustered to the boats.
Falls were thrown off the hooks and we stood
by to lower as soon as the captain gave the word.
There was equal bustle on the other ships. Traveling
before a favoring breeze in the same direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[ 199 ]</a></span>
as the whales, the three vessels waited until
they could work closer. Each captain in the
meanwhile kept a watchful eye on the others.
None of them proposed to let his rivals get the
start. The <i>Reindeer</i> was to windward of us,
the <i>Helen Marr</i> on our lee.</p>

<p>When the ships had reached within a mile of
the whales Captain Shorey sent our boats down.
Instantly the other skippers did the same. Soon
thirteen whale boats were speeding on the chase.</p>

<p>Fine sailing weather it was, with a fresh breeze
ruffling the surface of a gently heaving sea.
With all sails set and keeping well apart, the
boats heeled over, their crews sitting lined up
along the weather gunwales. There seemed no
chance of any clash or misunderstanding. There
were plenty of whales, and with any luck there
would be glory enough and profit enough for all.</p>

<p>Like a line of skirmishers deployed against an
enemy, the boats stole silently toward the whales.
We soon saw the great animals were busy feeding.
A few inches below the surface the sea
was filled with "whale food," a round, diaphanous,
disk-like jellyfish about the size of a silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[ 200 ]</a></span>
dollar and perfectly white. When he arrived in
this Arctic Ocean whale pasture the water
seemed snowy with the millions of jellyfish.
With open jaws, the whales swam this way and
that, making zigzag swaths a hundred yards long
through the gelatinous masses, their great heads
and backs well out of water, their fins now and
then flapping ponderously. When they had entangled
a sufficient quantity of the jellyfish in
the long hair hanging from the inner edges
of their teeth they closed their mouths with reverberating
snaps that sent the water splashing
out on either side.</p>

<p>Before the whales were aware of danger, the
boats rushed in among them. Each boatheader
singled out a whale, and five boats were quickly
fast&mdash;two from the <i>Reindeer</i>, two from the
<i>Helen Marr</i>, and Mr. Winchester's boat. Wild
turmoil and confusion instantly ensued among
the great animals. They went plunging below
in alarm and the boats that made no strike at
the first onslaught had no chance thereafter. The
whales did not stop to investigate the causes of
the sudden interruption of their banquet. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[ 201 ]</a></span>
sea swallowed them up and we did not see them
again. A little later we caught a glimpse of
their fountains twinkling against the sky on the
far horizon.</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester's whale was wriggling about
among the jellyfish with jaws widely distended
when the boat slipped silently upon it. As the
prow bumped against its black skin, Long John
drove a harpoon up to the hitches in its back.
With a tonite bomb shattered in its vitals, the
monster sounded in a smother of foam. In the
dynamic violence with which it got under way
it literally stood on its head. Its flukes, easily
twenty feet from tip to tip, shot at least thirty
feet into the air. They swung over to one side,
the great body forming a high arch, and struck
the sea with a resounding smack. Then they
sailed on high again to come down on the other
side with another broadside smash. Again they
rose like lightning into the air and the whale
seemed to slip down perpendicularly into the
ocean.</p>

<p>It was evident at the outset that the animal
was badly wounded. It swam only a short distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[ 202 ]</a></span>
below the surface and not rapidly, sending
up thousands of bubbles to mark its course.
This broad highway of bubbles curved and
turned, but Mr. Winchester, who had been smart
enough not to lower his sail, followed it as a
hound follows the trail of a deer. The boat
sailed almost as swiftly as the whale swam and
was able to keep almost directly above it. When
the whale came to the surface the mate was upon
it and Long John's second harpoon stopped it
dead in its track. The whale went through no
flurry, but died instantly and rolled over on its
back.</p>

<p>With excitement all about, there was nothing
for Mr. Landers or Gabriel to do. So we sat
still in the boats and watched the swift incidents
of the far-flung battle.</p>

<p>One of the whales struck by a boat from the
<i>Reindeer</i> breached almost completely out of
water as soon as it felt the sting of the harpoon.
It floundered down like a falling tower, rolled
about for a moment before sinking to a swimming
depth, and made off at mad speed. It
rose within twenty feet of where our boat lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[ 203 ]</a></span>
at a standstill and we could see its wild eye, as
big as a saucer, as the injured creature blew up
a fountain whose bloody spray fell all over us.
The boat it was dragging soon went flashing past
us, the crew sitting crouched down and silent.</p>

<p>"Swing to him, fellers," shouted Kaiuli,
standing up and waving his hat about his head.</p>

<p>But the others paid no attention to our South
Sea island savage. They were intent just then
on tragedy. Their boat struck the whale at its
next rise. The animal went into a violent flurry.
It beat the sea into a lather with fins and flukes
and darted around on its side in a semi-circle,
clashing its great jaws, until it finally collapsed
and lay limp and lifeless.</p>

<p>The whale struck by the other boat from the
Reindeer ran out a tub of line, but a second boat
had come up in time to bend on its own line
and took the animal in tow. Before the whale
had run out this new tub, a third boat harpooned
it. With two boats fast to it, it continued its
flight to windward and was at least two miles
from us when its pursuers at last overtook and
killed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[ 204 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Two boats from the <i>Helen Marr</i> struck
whales while the monsters were feeding within
an oar's length of each other. One whale started
off at right angles to the direction taken by the
other. It looked for a time as if the two lines
would become entangled and the boats would
crash together. But the whale that cut across
the other's course swam above the latter's line
and dragged its boat so swiftly after it that a
collision was averted by a few feet.</p>

<p>One of the whales was bombed and killed after
a short flight. The other acted in a way that
whales hardly ever act. It ran hard to windward
at first, as whales usually do when struck.
Then it suddenly turned and ran in an exactly
opposite direction. This unexpected change in
its course almost upset the boat, which was
jerked violently over on its beam-ends and spun
round like a top, while the crew held on for dear
life and barely escaped being pitched into the
sea. Once righted and on its way again, the
boat rapidly hauled up on the whale, whose fast-going
vitality showed in its diminished speed.
After a flight that had covered at least a mile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[ 205 ]</a></span>
the whale was finally killed close to the spot at
which it had first been struck.</p>

<p>When, the sharp, fast work of the boats ended,
five mighty carcasses lay stretched upon the sea.
The great whale drive, which had lasted less
than an hour, had bagged game worth something
like $60,000.</p>

<p>The three ships soon sailed to close quarters
and the boats had a comparatively easy time getting
the whales alongside. That night the try-works
were started and big cressets whose flames
were fed by "scrap" flared up on all the ships,
lighting them in ghostly-wise from the deck to
the topmost sail.</p>

<p>At the cutting in of this whale I had my first
experience at the windlass. The heaviest labor
falls to the sailors who man the windlass and
hoist in the great blanket pieces of blubber and
the "old head." Gabriel, the happiest-spirited
old soul aboard, bossed the job, as he always did,
and cheered the sailors and made the hard work
seem like play by his constant chanteys&mdash;those
catchy, tuneful, working songs of the sea. All
the old sailors on the brig knew these songs by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[ 206 ]</a></span>
heart and often sang them on the topsail halyard
or while reefing on the topsail yard. The green
hands soon picked up the words and airs of the
choruses and joined in. The day laborer on land
has no idea how work at sea is lightened by these
songs.</p>

<p>Gabriel knew no end of them, and in a round,
musical voice led the men at the windlass in such
rollicking old-time sea airs as "Whiskey for the
Johnnies," "Blow the Man Down," "Blow,
Boys, Blow," and "Rolling Rio." He would
sing a verse and the sailors would stand with
their hands on the windlass bars until he had
concluded. Then they would heave away with
a will and make the pawls clank and clatter as
they roared out the chorus. The old negro's
favorite was "Whiskey for the Johnnies." It
had a fine rousing chorus and we liked to sing it
not only for its stirring melody but because we
always harbored a hope&mdash;which, I may add, was
never realized&mdash;that the captain would be
touched by the words and send forward a drop
of liquor with which to wet our whistles. Gabriel
would begin in this way:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[ 207 ]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O whiskey is the life of man."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the sailors as they heaved would chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O whiskey, O Johnny.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O whiskey is the life of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whiskey for the Johnnies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then Gabriel would sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whiskey killed my poor old dad,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whiskey drove my mother mad,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whiskey caused me much abuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whiskey put me in the calaboose,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whiskey fills a man with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whiskey makes a man a bear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the men would come through with the
refrain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whiskey, Johnny.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I drink whiskey when I can.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O whiskey for the Johnnies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the end of our song which ran through
verses enough to bring a blanket piece of blubber
swinging inboard, we would look wistfully
toward the quarter-deck and wonder if the "old
man" would take our musical hint.</p>

<p>Or Gabriel would start up "Rolling Rio":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'll sing you a song of the fish of the sea."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The men would thunder:</p>

<span class="i0">"Rolling Rio."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gabriel would continue:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[ 208 ]</a></span></p>

<p>And the sailors would sing:</p>

<span class="i1">Hurrah, you Rio, rolling Rio.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So fare you well, my pretty young girl,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'm bound for the Rio Grande."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Blow, Boys, Blow" was another with which
we made the Arctic ring. The other ships could
not have failed to hear its swinging rhythm as it
burst from our lusty lungs in this fashion:</p>

<p>So with a heave and a song we soon had our
whale stowed, bone and blubber, below hatches.
The <i>Reindeer</i> and the <i>Helen Marr</i> had drifted
far away from us by the time our work was
finished, but they were still in sight and their try-works
smoking. Our whale yielded 1,800 pounds
of bone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">A NARROW PINCH</p>


<p>The whaling fleet divided soon after entering
the Arctic Ocean. Some of the ships
went straight on north to the whaling
grounds about Point Barrow and Herschel Island.
The others bore to the westward for the
whaling along the ice north of eastern Siberia.
We stood to the westward. In a few days we
had raised the white coasts of a continent of ice
that shut in all the north as far as the eye could
see and extended to the Pole and far beyond.
With the winds in the autumn always blowing
from the northwest, the sea was perfectly calm
in the lee of this indestructible polar cap. I
have been out in the whale boats when they
were heeled over on their beam-ends under
double-reefed sails before a gale of wind upon
a sea as smooth as the waters of a duck pond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[ 211 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now no longer bright twilight at midnight.
The sun already well on its journey to
the equator, sank earlier and deeper below the
horizon. Several hours of darkness began to
intervene between its setting and its rising. By
September we had a regular succession of days
and nights.</p>

<p>With the return of night we saw for the first
time that electric phenomenon of the Far North,
the aurora borealis. Every night during our
stay in the Arctic the skies were made brilliant
with these shooting lights. I had expected to
see waving curtains of rainbow colors, but I saw
no colors at any time. The auroras of those
skies were of pure white light. A great arch
would suddenly shoot across the zenith from
horizon to horizon. It was nebulously bright,
like a shining milky way or a path of snow upon
which moonlight sparkles. You could hear it
rustle and crackle distinctly, with a sound like
that of heavy silk violently shaken. It shed a
cold white radiance over the sea like the light of
arc lamps, much brighter than the strongest
moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[ 212 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not quite bright enough to read by&mdash;but
almost&mdash;and it threw sharp, black shadows
on the deck. Gradually the arch would fade, to
be succeeded by others that spanned the heavens
from other angles. Often several arches and
segments were in the sky at the same time.
Sometimes, though rarely, the aurora assumed
the form of a curtain hanging vertically along
the horizon and shimmered as though agitated
by a strong wind.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the temperatures
encountered in the Arctic. We were in
the polar ocean until early in October, but the
lowest temperature recorded by the brig's thermometer
was 10 degrees below zero. Such a
temperature seems colder on sea than on land.
Greater dampness has something to do with it,
but imagination probably plays its part. There
is something in the very look of a winter sea,
yeasty under the north wind and filled with
snowy floes and icebergs, that seems to congeal
the marrow in one's bones. In the cold snaps,
when a big wave curled over the bows, I have
seen it break and strike upon the deck in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[ 213 ]</a></span>
form of hundreds of ice pellets. Almost every
day when it was rough, the old Arctic played
marbles with us.</p>

<p>What with the mists, the cold rains, the sleets
and snows and flying spray, the brig was soon
a mass of ice. The sides became encased in a
white armor of ice which at the bows was several
feet thick. We frequently had to knock it
off. The decks were sheeted with ice, the masts
and spars were glazed with it, the shrouds,
stays, and every rope were coated with ice, and
the yard-arms and foot-ropes were hung with ice
stalactites. One of the most beautiful sights I
ever saw was the whaling fleet when we fell in
with it one cold, gray morning. The frost had
laid its white witchery upon the other ships as
it had upon the brig, and they glided through
the black seas, pallid, shimmering, and phantom-like
in their ice armor&mdash;an armada of ghostly
<i>Flying Dutchmen</i>.</p>

<p>The brig was constantly wearing and tacking
on the whaling grounds and there was considerable
work to be done aloft. By the captain's
orders, we did such work with our mittens off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[ 214 ]</a></span>
Hauling bare-handed on ropes of solid ice was
painful labor, and "Belay all!" often came like
a benediction to souls in torment. Then we had
much ado whipping our hands against our sides
to restore the circulation. After Big Foot Louis
had frozen a finger, the captain permitted us to
keep our mittens on.</p>

<p>Work aloft under such conditions was dangerous.
Our walrus-hide boots were heelless
and extremely slippery and our footing on the
foot-ropes was precarious. We had to depend
as much upon our hands as upon our feet to
keep from falling when strung out for reefing
along the topsail yard. Many were the slips
and hair-breadth escapes. It seems now, on
looking back on it, almost miraculous that some
of us green hands did not tumble to our death.</p>

<p>We saw whales frequently. Sometimes the
boats were lowered half a dozen times a day.
Often we spent whole days in the boats, and
even in our skin clothes it was freezing business
sitting still on the gunwale of a beam-ended boat
driving along at thrilling speed in the teeth of
an Arctic gale. Our skipper was a good gambler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[ 215 ]</a></span>
and he lowered whenever there was an off
chance to bag a leviathan.</p>

<p>As we worked to the westward, twin peaks
rose out of the sea ahead of us. Covered with
snow and ice, they stood out against the sky as
white as marble. It was our first glimpse of
Herald Island, in latitude 71 degrees north. We
sailed north of the island and close to it. It
looked forbiddingly desolate. Along the shores
there was a rampart of black rock. Nowhere
else was a glimpse of earth or herbage of any
sort. The island was a gleaming white mass of
snow and ice from the dark sea to the tips of the
twin mountains. It was discovered in 1849 by
Captain Kellett of the English ship <i>Herald</i> and
named after his vessel. Captain De Long,
leader of the ill-fated <i>Jeanette</i> expedition, was
frozen in close to the island in the winter of
1880. He found polar bear plentiful and
trapped and shot a number.</p>

<p>Here at Herald Island we fell in with eighteen
ships of the whaling fleet&mdash;all that had
cruised to the westward&mdash;and it was only by
good luck that some of them did not leave their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[ 216 ]</a></span>
hulks on those desolate shores. The polar pack
rested solidly against the island's western end
and curved in a great half-moon to the north
and east. The pocket thus formed between the
island and the ice looked good for whales and
the ships hunted it out carefully.</p>

<p>Far to the eastward, a long arm of ice reached
out from the pack and grasped the island's eastern
end. This arm was perhaps a mile wide.
It barred our passage back to the open sea. The
ships had been caught in a trap. They were
bottled up in a hole of water perhaps a hundred
square miles in extent. Busy on the lookout for
whales, the captains of the fleet did not realize
the situation for several hours. When they discovered
their predicament, they hurried to the
crow's-nests with glasses to try to spy out an
avenue of escape. Sail was cracked on. The
ships began to fly about like panic-stricken living
creatures.</p>

<p>The great polar pack was pressing rapidly
toward the island. Unless the ships escaped, it
seemed likely they would be securely hemmed in
before night. In this event, if they escaped
wreck by ice pressure they faced the prospect of
lying still in an ice bed until the pack broke up
in the spring.</p>

<p><a id="fp216"></a><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[ 217 ]</a></span></p>

<p>All day long the frightened ships scurried up
and down the ice barrier without finding an
opening. They ran to the westward. There
was no escape there. They flew back to the
east. An ice wall confronted them. The case
seemed hopeless. The panic of the captains became
more and more evident. If a ship hurried
off in any direction, the other ships flocked after
her like so many scared sheep. Morning and
afternoon passed in this wild search for an outlet.
Night was coming on.</p>

<p>A bark squared her yards and shot away to
the southeast. It was the <i>Sea Breeze</i>. When
the others expected her to tack, she did no such
thing, but kept going straight ahead. On she
went alone, far from the fleet. It was exciting
to watch that single ship flying eastward. What
could it mean? Had she found an opening?
The other ships turned their prows after her,
one by one. A long line of vessels soon was
careering in the wake of the <i>Sea Breeze</i>. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[ 218 ]</a></span>
had dwindled to a little ship in the far distance
when at last we saw her break out the American
colors at her mizzen peak. Every man aboard
the brig gave a cheer. Cheers from the other
ships came across the water. It meant that the
<i>Sea Breeze</i> was clear.</p>

<p>She had found a lead that suddenly had
opened through the eastern ice strip, as leads
will open in drifting floes. The lead was not
entirely clear. A narrow strip of ice lay across
it. The <i>Sea Breeze</i> butted through this strip
and sailed on to freedom. The other vessels followed.
Our brig was the tenth ship to pass
through. As we negotiated the narrow passage,
the ice was so close on both sides we could have
leaped upon it from the bulwarks. It was with
a joyous sense of escape that we cleared the pack
and swung once more on the open sea. Soon
after the last ship of the fleet had bumped her
way to safety the ice closed solidly behind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">A RACE AND A RACE HORSE</p>


<p>Early one morning the old familiar cry
rang from the crow's-nest&mdash;"Blo-o-o-w."</p>

<p>A lone whale, in plain view from the deck,
was sporting lazily on the surface about a mile
and a half off our starboard bow. The three
boats were hurriedly lowered and the crews
scrambled in. We took to the oars, for not a
breath of air was stirring and the sea was as
smooth as polished silver. Away went the boats
together, as if from a starting line at the crack
of a pistol, with the whale as the goal and prize
of the race.</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester had often boasted of the superiority
of his crew. Mr. Landers had not
seemed interested in the question, but Gabriel
resented the assumption. "Just wait," he used
to say to us confidentially. "We'll show him
which is de bes' crew. Our time'll come." The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[ 220 ]</a></span>
men of the mate's boat had shared their officer's
vainglorious opinion. They had long swaggered
among us with a self-complacent assurance that
made us smart. Our chance had at last come
to prove their pride a mockery under the skipper's
eyes. If ever men wanted, from the bottom
of their hearts, to win, we did. We not only
had our name as skillful oarsmen to vindicate,
but a grudge to wipe out.</p>

<p>So evenly matched were the crews that the
boats rushed along side by side for at least half
a mile, Mr. Winchester insouciant and superciliously
smiling, Mr. Landers indifferent, Gabriel
all eagerness and excitement. Perhaps
Mr. Landers knew his crew was outclassed. If
he did not, he was not long in finding it out,
for his boat began to drop steadily behind and
was soon hopelessly out of the contest. But the
other two crews, stroke for stroke, were proving
foemen worthy of each other's prowess.</p>

<p>"Oho, Gabriel," Mr. Winchester laughed
contemptuously, "you think your boat can out-pull
us, eh? Bet you ten pounds of tobacco
we beat you to the whale."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[ 221 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"I take you," cried Gabriel excitedly. "Dat's
a bet."</p>

<p>If Gabriel accepted the challenge, so did we,
and right heartily at that. We threw ourselves,
heart and soul, into the struggle. The men in
the mate's boat, holding us cheaply, believed they
could draw away whenever they chose and go
on to win, hands down. The mate kept looking
over at us, a supercilious smile still curling the
corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Come on now, my boys," he cried. "All together.
Shake her up a bit. Give those fellows
a taste of your mettle."</p>

<p>We heard his words as distinctly as his own
crew heard them&mdash;he was only a few boat
lengths away. They inspired us to greater
exertion than they inspired his own men. They
spurted. So did we. Still the two boats raced
neck and neck. We were not to be shaken off.
The mate looked disconcerted. His men had
done their level best to take the lead and they
had failed. That spurt marked the crisis of the
race.</p>

<p>The mate's smile faded out. His face grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[ 222 ]</a></span>
anxious. Then it hardened into an expression
of grim determination. He had sat motionless
at the beginning. Now when he saw his vaunted
superiority slipping through his fingers he began
to "jockey"&mdash;throwing his body forward in violent
lunges at every stroke of the sweeps, pushing
with all his might on the stroke oar, and
booming out, "Pull, my boys; pull away, my
boys."</p>

<p>But old Gabriel was "jockeying," too, and
encouraging us in the same fashion.</p>

<p>"We show dat mate," he kept repeating.
"We show him. Steady together, my lads.
Pull away!"</p>

<p>And we pulled as if our lives depended on it,
bending to the oars with every ounce of our
strength, making the long sweeps bend in the
water. We began to forge ahead, very slowly,
inch by inch. We saw it&mdash;it cheered us to
stronger effort. Our rivals saw it&mdash;it discouraged
them. Under the heart-breaking strain
they began to tire. They slipped back little by
little. They spurted again. It was no use. We
increased our advantage. Open daylight began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[ 223 ]</a></span>
to broaden between the stern of our boat and the
bow of theirs. They were beaten in a fair trial
of strength, oarsmanship, and endurance.</p>

<p>"Ha, my boys," chuckled Gabriel. "We win.
Good-by to dat mate. Now we catch dat whale."</p>

<p>We shot along at undiminished speed, pulling
exultantly. What the whale was doing or how
close we were to it, we at the oars could not
see.</p>

<p>"Stand by, Louis," said Gabriel presently.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," responded Louis.</p>

<p>A few more strokes and a great black bulk
loomed close alongside.</p>

<p>"Give it to him, Louis," cried Gabriel.</p>

<p>And as the boat glanced against that island
of living ebony, Louis's harpoon sank deep into
the soft, buttery mass. We heard the tiny concussion
of the cap of the tonite gun, and a fraction
of a second later the bomb exploded with
a muffled roar in the whale's vitals.</p>

<p>"Stern, stern!" shouted Gabriel. "Stern for
your lives!"</p>

<p>We backed water as hard as we could. The
great back went flashing down, the mighty tail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[ 224 ]</a></span>
rose up directly over us, shutting out the sky.
It curled over away from us and smote the sea
with deafening thunder. As quick as lightning
it rose into the air again, curled high above us
with tragic menace, and came crashing down,
this time toward us. But we had backed just out
of harm's way. Death and that terrible tail
missed us by about three feet.</p>

<p>The mate's boat came rushing up. It was too
late. The whale&mdash;our whale&mdash;had sounded.</p>

<p>"Your boat can beat us, eh?" Gabriel called
tauntingly to Mr. Winchester. "Not much. I
know we break blackskin first. I know we win
dat race."</p>

<p>Our line began to dance and sing, leaping up
from its neatly laid coils in the tub in dizzy
spirals and humming out over the bow.</p>

<p>"Ha, boys," sang out Kaiuli, our Kanaka
bow oarsman. "Now for fine ride behind Arctic
race horse&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>With a whale harnessed to our boat and a sea
as smooth as any turnpike for our highway, we
settled ourselves for the ride. The friction of
the line set the boat going. It gathered momentum.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[ 225 ]</a></span>
In a little while we were tearing along
through that sea of oil, our bow deep in the
smother as the whale pulled down upon it, and
flashing walls of white spray flaring out on
either side.</p>

<p>The other boats pulled for the point at which
it seemed most probable the whale would come
up. When it rose to the surface, the mate's boat
was nearest.</p>

<p>"Lay me on four seas off and I'll get him,"
we heard Long John shout to Mr. Winchester.
The mate did just that. The whale was up but
a moment and Long John tried for it, but it was
too long a dart, and his harpoon fell into the sea.
Before he had recovered his iron we had shot
past. When the whale rose again, we bumped
out of water on its body. A second harpoon
drove home in its back, a second bomb exploded
in its insides. A great shudder seized the monster.
The water foamed white with its throes.
Then everything grew still. Slowly the great
body rolled over, belly up.</p>

<p>Big Foot Louis danced up and down in the
bow, raising his knees high in a sort of joyful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[ 226 ]</a></span>
cake-walk. Gabriel, equally excited, waved his
hat.</p>

<p>"By golly," he shouted, "dat mate don't
strike him. Dat feesh is all ours. It takes old
Gabriel fer kill de whale, by golly."</p>

<p>When we got back to the brig we looked like
snow-powdered Santa Clauses. The spray
kicked up in our wild ride behind the Arctic
Ocean race horse had wet us from head to foot
and, freezing on our fur clothes, had frosted
us all over with fine white ice. Mr. Winchester
was a good sportsman and paid his bet promptly.
Out of his winnings Gabriel gave each man of his
boat's crew a plug of tobacco.</p>

<p>After the whale had been brought alongside
the ship and the blubber had been peeled off its
body, it fell to the lot of Big Foot Louis to cut
in the "old head." It was his first opportunity
to show his experience in such work and he was
as elated as a boy. He threw off his coat with
a theatrical flourish, hitched up his trousers,
seized an axe, and with an air of bravado climbed
down on the stripped carcass. A little sea had
begun to run and the whale was bending sinuously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[ 227 ]</a></span>
throughout its length and rolling slightly
from side to side.</p>

<p>Louis chopped two little ledges in the whale's
flesh with the deftness of an old hand, and planting
his feet in these, began raining blows with
his axe on the neck. He was getting on famously,
and the crew, hanging over the bulwarks,
was watching with admiring eyes. Suddenly
the whale gave an unexpectedly violent
roll&mdash;our Arctic Ocean race horse was proving
a bronco even in death&mdash;and Louis's big foot
slipped off into the water. He lost his balance,
pitched forward, and sprawled face downward
on the whale, his axe sailing away and plunking
into the sea. He clutched frantically at the
whale, but every grip slipped loose and, inch by
inch, with eyeballs popping out of his head, he
slid off into the sea and with a yell went under.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed. The captain held his
sides and the officers on the cutting stage almost
fell off in the violence of their mirth. Louis
came up spluttering and splashing. He was an
expert swimmer, as expert as the Kanakas
among whom he had lived for years, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[ 228 ]</a></span>
needed all his skill to keep afloat in his heavy
boots and skin clothes. As soon as the mate
could control his merriment, he stuck the long
handle of his spade down and Louis grasped it
and was pulled back on the whale's body. He
sat there, dripping and shivering and with chattering
teeth, rolling his white eyes up at the
laughing crew along the rail with a tragic "Et
tu, Brute" expression. He couldn't see the
joke.</p>

<p>"Lemme aboard," he whimpered.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," roared the captain,
"and cut in that head."</p>

<p>Louis lived in mortal fear of the skipper, and
the way he straightened up in his slippery seat
and said "Aye, aye, sir!" made the crew burst
out laughing again. Another axe was passed
down to him. He floundered to his feet, and
though he found it harder than ever in his wet
boots to keep his footing, and slipped more than
once and almost fell off again, he finally succeeded
in cutting off the head. He had regained
his air of bravado by the time he had scrambled
back on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[ 229 ]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty close shave, Louis," ventured a sailor.</p>

<p>"Humph," returned Louis, "dat's nothin'&mdash;nothin'
at all." And with quite lordly dignity,
despite the dripping brine, he stalked off to the
cabin to change his clothes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">BEARS FOR A CHANGE</p>


<p>Soon after taking our third whale, we saw
our first polar bears&mdash;two of them on a
narrow floe of ice. When the brig was
within fifty yards of them the mate got out his
rifle and began blazing away. His first shot
struck one of the bears in the hind leg. The
animal wheeled and snapped at the wound.
The second shot stretched it out dead. The
second bear was hit somewhere in the body and,
plunging into the sea, it struck out on a three-mile
swim for the main ice pack. It swam with
head and shoulders out, cleaving the water like
a high-power launch and leaving a creaming
wake behind. Moving so swiftly across the
brig's course, it made a difficult target.</p>

<p>"I'm going down after that fellow," said Mr.
Winchester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[ 231 ]</a></span></p>

<p>He called a boat's crew and lowered, taking
his place in the bow with his rifle, while Long
John sat at the tiller. He had got only a short
distance from the ship when Captain Shorey
ordered Gabriel after him.</p>

<p>"Killing that bear may be a bigger job than
he thinks," he said. "Lower a boat, Mr. Gabriel,
and lend a hand. It may be needed."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Gabriel was heading after
the mate's boat. Neither boat hoisted sail. With
four men at the sweeps, it was as much as the
boats could do to gain on the brute. If the bear
was not making fifteen miles an hour, I'm no
judge.</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester kept pegging away, his bullets
knocking up water all around the animal.
One ball struck the bear in the back. That decided
the animal to change its tactics. It quit
running away and turned and made directly for
its enemies.</p>

<p>"Avast rowing," sang out the mate.</p>

<p>The men peaked their oars, turned on the
thwarts, and had their first chance to watch developments,
which came thick and fast. Rabid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[ 232 ]</a></span>
ferocity, blind fury, and deadly menace were in
every line of that big white head shooting across
the water toward them. The boat sat stationary
on a dancing sea. The mate's rifle cracked repeatedly.
The bullets peppered the sea, sending
up little spurts of water all about the bear. But
the beast did not notice them, never tried to
dodge, never swerved aside&mdash;just kept rushing
for the boat with the directness of an arrow.</p>

<p>It was a time of keen excitement for the men
in the boat. They kept glancing with an "Oh,
that Bl&uuml;cher or night would come" expression
toward Gabriel's boat, which was doing all that
oars could do to get into the fray, Big Foot
Louis standing all the while in the bow with
harpoon ready. The bobbing of his boat disconcerted
the mate's aim. Though he was a
crack shot, as he had often proved among the
okchugs, I never saw him shoot so badly. But
he kept banging away, and when the bear was
within fifteen or twenty yards he got home a
ball in its shoulder. The beast plunged into the
air, snarling and clawing at the sea, then rushed
again for the boat like a white streak. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[ 233 ]</a></span>
rammed into the boat bows-on, stuck one mighty
paw over the gunwale, and with a snarling roar
and a frothing snap of glistening fangs, leaped
up and tried to climb aboard.</p>

<p>Just at this critical instant Gabriel's boat
came into action with a port helm. Louis drove
a harpoon into the beast behind the shoulder&mdash;drove
it up to the haft, so that the spear-head
burst out on the other side. At the same moment
the mate stuck the muzzle of his rifle almost
down the bear's throat and fired. The great
brute fell back into the water, clawed and
plunged and roared and clashed its teeth and
so, in a whirlwind of impotent fury, died.</p>

<p>For a moment it lay limp and still among the
lapping waves, then slowly began to sink. But
Louis held it up with the harpoon line and the
animal was towed back to the brig. It measured
over seven feet in length and weighed 1,700
pounds&mdash;a powerful, gaunt old giant, every inch
bone and sinew. Mr. Winchester retrieved the
other bear from the ice floe. It was considerably
smaller. The pelts were stripped off and
the carcasses thrown overboard. The skins were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[ 234 ]</a></span>
in good condition, despite the earliness of the
season. They were stretched on frames fashioned
by the cooper, and tanned.</p>

<p>A week or so later we sighted a lone bear on
an ice floe making a meal off a seal it had killed.
It was late in the afternoon and one had to look
twice before being able to make out its white
body against the background of snow-covered
ice. When the brig sailed within seventy-five
yards the bear raised its head for a moment, took
a squint at the vessel, didn't seem interested, and
went on eating.</p>

<p>Resting his rifle on the bulwarks and taking
careful aim, Mr. Winchester opened fire. The
pattering of the bullets on the ice seemed to
puzzle the bear. As it heard the missiles sing
and saw the snow spurt up, it left the seal and
began walking all about the floe on an investigation.
Finally it reared on its hind legs to its
full height. While in this upright position, a
bullet struck it and turned it a sudden twisting
somersault. Its placid mood was instantly succeeded
by one of ferocious anger. It looked
toward the vessel and roared savagely. Still the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[ 235 ]</a></span>
bullets fell about it, and now alive to its danger,
it plunged into the sea and struck out for the
polar pack a mile distant.</p>

<p>Mr. Winchester again lowered, with Gabriel's
boat to back him up. The chase was short and
swift. The boats began to overhaul the bear as
it approached the ice, the mate's bullets splashing
all about the animal, but doing no damage.
As the brute was hauling itself upon the ice, a
ball crashed into its back, breaking its spine. It
fell back into the water and expired in a furious
flurry. A running bowline having been slipped
over its neck, it was towed back to the brig.</p>

<p>Not long afterward, while we were cruising in
open water, a polar bear swam across the brig's
stern. There was neither ice nor land in sight.
Figuring the ship's deck as the center of a circle
of vision about ten miles in diameter, the bear
already had swum five miles, and probably quite
a bit more, and it is certain he had an equal
distance to go before finding any ice on which
to rest. It probably had drifted south on an ice
pan and was bound back for its home on the
polar pack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[ 236 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The bear made too tempting a target for the
mate to resist, and he brought out his rifle and,
kneeling on the quarter-deck, he took steady aim
and fired. His bullet struck about two feet behind
the animal. He aimed again, but changed
his mind and lowered his gun.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "that fellow's making too fine
a swim. I'll let him go."</p>

<p>Cleaving the water with a powerful stroke,
the bear went streaking out of sight over the
horizon. It is safe to say that before its swim
ended the animal covered fifteen miles at the
lowest estimate, and possibly a much greater
distance.</p>

<p>One moonlight night a little later, while we
were traveling under short sail with considerable
ice about, a whale blew a short distance to windward.
I was at the wheel and Mr. Landers was
standing near me. "Blow!" breathed Mr. Landers
softly. Suddenly the whale breached&mdash;we
could hear it distinctly as it shot up from a
narrow channel between ice floes. "There she
breaches!" said Mr. Landers in the same low
voice, with no particular concern. We thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[ 237 ]</a></span>
the big creature merely was enjoying a moonlight
frolic. It breached again. This time its
body crashed upon a strip of ice and flopped
and floundered for a moment before sliding back
into the water. Then it breached half a dozen
times more in rapid succession. I had never
seen a whale breach more than once at a time,
even when wounded. Mr. Landers became interested.
"I wonder what's the matter with
that whale," he said.</p>

<p>To our surprise, two other black bodies began
to flash up into the moonlight about the whale.
Every time the whale breached, they breached,
too. They were of huge size, but nothing like
so large as the whale.</p>

<p>"Killers!" cried Mr. Landers excitedly.</p>

<p>Then we knew the whale was not playing, but
fighting for its life. It leaped above the surface
to a lesser and lesser height each time.
Plainly it was tiring fast. When it breached
the last time only its head and a small portion
of its body rose into the air and both killers
seemed to be hanging with a bulldog grip upon
its lower jaw. What the outcome of that desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[ 238 ]</a></span>
battle was we did not see. The whale
and its savage assailants moved off out of eye-shot.
But for some time after we had lost sight
of the whale we could hear its labored and stertoreous
breathing and its heavy splashes as it
attempted to breach.</p>

<p>Killers, Mr. Landers told me, are themselves
a species of rapacious, carnivorous whale, whose
upper and lower jaws are armed with sharp,
saw-like teeth. They are otherwise known as the
Orca gladiator, and tiger-hearted gladiators of
the sea they are. The great, clumsy bowhead
with no teeth with which to defend itself, whose
only weapons are its flukes and its fins, is no
match for them. They attack the great creature
whenever they encounter it, and when it has
exhausted itself in its efforts to escape, they
tear open its jaws and feast upon its tongue.
The killer whale never hunts alone. It pursues
its titanic quarry in couples and trios, and sometimes
in veritable wolf-like packs of half a dozen.
There is usually no hope for the bowhead that
these relentless creatures mark for their prey.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">THE STRANDED WHALE</p>


<p>Our fourth and last whale gave us quite a
bit of trouble. We sighted this fellow
spouting in a choppy sea among ice islands
two or three miles off the edges of the
polar pack. All three boats lowered for it. It
was traveling slowly in the same direction the
brig was sailing and about two miles from the
vessel. It took the boats some time to work to
close quarters. When the mate's boat was almost
within striking distance, the whale went
under. As frightened whales usually run
against the wind, Mr. Winchester steered to
windward. But the whale had not been frightened;
it had not seen the boats. Consequently
it failed to head into the wind, but did the unexpected
by coming up to leeward, blowing with
evident unconcern. This brought it nearest to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[ 240 ]</a></span>
Gabriel, who went after it in a flash. After a
sharp, swift run down the wind, we struck the
whale, which dived and went racing under water
for the ice pack. The dizzy rate at which it
took out our line might have led us to believe
it was not hurt, but we knew it was seriously
wounded by the fountains of blood it sent up
whenever it came to the surface.</p>

<p>The captain's signals from the brig, by this
time, had headed the other boats in our direction,
but they could not reach us in time to be
of any assistance. The whale ran away with
our tub of line and we sat still and watched the
red fountains that marked its course as it headed
for the big ice to the north.</p>

<p>Directly in the whale's course lay an ice floe
about half a mile long, a few hundred yards wide
and rising from five to ten feet above the surface.
We naturally supposed the creature would dive
under this and keep going for the main pack.
To our surprise we soon saw fountain after fountain,
red with blood, shooting up from the center
of the floe. The whale evidently was too
badly injured to continue its flight and had
sought refuge beneath this strip of drifting ice.</p>

<p><a id="fp240"></a><span class="pagenum">&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[ 241 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Men were hurriedly landed from all the boats
with harpoons and shoulder guns, leaving enough
sailors on the thwarts to fend the boats clear of
the ice. The landing parties clambered over the
broken and tumbled ice, dragging the harpoon
lines. We found the whale half exposed in a
narrow opening in the center of the floe, all the
ice about it red with clotted blood. Long John
and Little Johnny threw two harpoons each into
the big body and Big Foot Louis threw his remaining
one. As a result of this bombardment,
five tonite bombs exploded in the whale, which,
with the harpoons sticking all over its back, suggested
a baited bull in a Spanish bullring hung
with the darts of the banderilleros. But the
great animal kept on breathing blood and would
not die. After all the harpoons had been exhausted,
shoulder guns were brought into play.
In all, twelve tonite bombs were fired into it
before the monster gave a mighty shiver and
lay still.</p>

<p>But with the whale dead, we still had a big
problem on our hands. In some way the giant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[ 242 ]</a></span>
bulk had to be hauled out of the ice. This was
a difficult matter even with plenty of time in
which to do it. Night was coming on and it was
the brig's custom in the hours of darkness to
sail far away from the great ice pack with its
edging of floating bergs and floes in order to
avoid possible accident and to sail back to the
whaling grounds on the morrow. This Captain
Shorey prepared to do now. As a solution of the
dilemma, an empty bread cask or hogshead was
brought on deck and the name of the brig was
seared in its staves with a hot iron in several
places. This cask was towed to the floe, hauled
up on the edge of the ice, and the long line of
one of the harpoons sticking in the whale was
made fast to it by means of staples. Thus the
cask marked the floe in which the whale was
lying.</p>

<p>It was growing dark when the brig went
about, said good-night to the whale, and headed
for open water to the south. We sailed away
before a stiff breeze and soon cask and floe and
the great white continent beyond had faded
from view. When morning broke we were bowling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[ 243 ]</a></span>
along under light sail in a choppy sea with
nothing but water to be seen in any direction.
The great ice cap was somewhere out of sight
over the world's northern rim. Not a floe, a
berg, or the smallest white chunk of ice floated
anywhere in the purple sphere of sea ringed by
the wide horizon. Being a green hand, I said to
myself, "Good-bye, Mr. Whale, we certainly
have seen the last we'll ever see of you."</p>

<p>Let me make the situation perfectly clear.
Our whale was drifting somewhere about the
Arctic Ocean embedded in an ice floe scarcely
to be distinguished from a thousand other floes
except by a cask upon its margin which at a
distance of a few miles would hardly be visible
through strong marine glasses. The floe, remember,
was not a stationary object whose longitude
and latitude could be reckoned certainly,
but was being tossed about by the sea and driven
by the winds and ocean currents. The brig, on
the other hand, had been sailing on the wind
without a set course. It had been tacking and
wearing from time to time. It, too, had felt the
compulsion of the waves and currents. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[ 244 ]</a></span>
throughout the night the brig had sailed at random
and twenty miles or so away the whale in
its floe had been drifting at random. Now how
were we going to find our whale again? This
struck me that morning on the open sea with
neither whale nor ice in sight, as a problem certainly
very nice, if not hopeless. The way it was
solved was as pretty a feat of navigation as I
ever saw.</p>

<p>When Captain Shorey came on deck after
breakfast, he "shot the sun" through his sextant
and went below to make his calculations.
In a little while he came on deck again and
stepped to the man at the wheel. The helmsman
was steering full and by.</p>

<p>"How do you head?" asked Captain Shorey.</p>

<p>"Northwest," answered the sailor.</p>

<p>"Keep her northwest by west half west," said
the captain.</p>

<p>For several hours the brig sailed steadily on
this course. Along about 9 o'clock, we saw the
peculiar, cold, light look above the sky line ahead
which meant ice and which sailors call an "ice
horizon," to be distinguished at a glance from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[ 245 ]</a></span>
a water horizon, which is dark. A little later,
we sighted the white loom of the great ice continent.
Later still, we picked up the bergs,
floes, islands, and chunks of ice which drift forever
along its edge.</p>

<p>The brig kept on its course. A floe of ice,
looking at a distance like a long, narrow ribbon,
lay ahead of us, apparently directly across our
path. As we drew nearer, we began to make
out dimly a certain dark speck upon the edge of
the ice. This speck gradually assumed definiteness.
It was our cask and we were headed
straight for it. To a landlubber unacquainted
with the mysteries of navigation, this incident
may seem almost unbelievable, but upon my
honest word, it is true to the last detail.</p>

<p>After the brig had been laid aback near the
ice, a boat was lowered and a hole was cut in
the bow of the whale's head. A cable was
passed through this and the other end was made
fast aboard the ship. Then under light sail, the
brig set about the work of pulling the whale out
of the ice. The light breeze fell away and the
three boats were strung out ahead with hawsers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[ 246 ]</a></span>
and lent assistance with the oars. It was
slow work. But when the breeze freshened, the
ice began gradually to give, then to open up,
and finally the whale was hauled clear and
drawn alongside for the cutting in.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">AND SO&mdash;HOME</p>


<p>It was on October tenth that we broke out
the Stars and Stripes at our main gaff and
squared our yards for home. Everybody
cheered as the flag went fluttering up, for everybody
was glad that the end of the long, hard
voyage was in sight. Behring Straits which
when we were about to enter the Arctic Ocean&mdash;sea
of tragedy and graveyard of so many brave
men and tall ships&mdash;had looked like the portals
of inferno, now when we were homeward bound
seemed like the gateway to the Happy Isles.</p>

<p>The four whales we had captured on the voyage
had averaged about 1,800 pounds of baleen,
which that year was quoted at $6.50 a pound.
We had tried out all our whales except the last
one and our casks were filled with oil. Our entire
catch was worth over $50,000. The officers
and boatsteerers made a pretty penny out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[ 248 ]</a></span>
the voyage. The captain, I was told, had
shipped on a lay of one-sixth&mdash;and got it. The
sailors had shipped on the 190th lay&mdash;and didn't
get it. That was the difference. At San Francisco,
the forecastle hands were paid off with the
"big iron dollar" of whaling tradition.</p>

<p>The homeward voyage was not a time of idleness.
We were kept busy a large part of the
time cleaning the bone of our last three whales&mdash;the
bone from our first whale had been shipped
to San Francisco from Unalaska. As we had
at first stowed it away, the baleen was in bunches
of ten or a dozen slabs held together at the roots
by "white horse," which is the whaler name for
the gums of the whale. These bunches were now
brought up on deck and each slab of baleen was
cut out of the gums separately and washed and
scoured with cocoanut rind procured for the
purpose in the Hawaiian Islands. Then the
slabs were dried and polished until they shone
like gun metal, tied into bales, and stowed under
hatches once more.</p>

<p>A little south of King's Island in the northern
end of Behring Sea, Captain Shorey set a course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[ 249 ]</a></span>
for Unimak Pass. We ran down Behring Sea
with a gale of wind sweeping us before it and
great billows bearing us along. When we bore
up for the dangerous passage which had given
us such a scare in the spring, we were headed
straight for it, and we went through into the Pacific
without pulling a rope. It was another remarkable
example of the navigating skill of
whaling captains. We had aimed at Unimak
Pass when 700 miles away and had scored a
bull's-eye.</p>

<p>Again the "roaring forties" lived up to their
name and buffeted us with gale and storm. The
first land we sighted after leaving the Fox
Islands was the wooded hills of northern California.
I shall never forget how beautiful those
hills appeared and what a welcome they seemed
to hold out. They were my own country again,
the United States&mdash;home. My eyes grew misty
as I gazed at them and I felt much as a small
boy might feel who, after long absence, sees his
mother's arms open to him. The tug that picked
us up outside of Golden Gate at sundown one
day seemed like a long lost friend. It was long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[ 250 ]</a></span>
after darkness had fallen, that it towed us into
San Francisco harbor, past the darkly frowning
Presidio and the twinkling lights of Telegraph
Hill, to an anchorage abreast the city, brilliantly
lighted and glowing like fairyland. I never in
all my life heard sweeter music than the rattle
and clank of the anchor chain as the great anchor
plunged into the bay and sank to its grip
in good American soil once more.</p>

<p>My whaling voyage was over. It was an adventure
out of the ordinary, an experience informing,
interesting, health-giving, and perhaps
worth while. I have never regretted it. But I
wouldn't do it again for ten thousand dollars.</p>
